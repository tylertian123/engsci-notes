## Petrocapitalism

* Expanded profit growth hinges on mass extraction of fossil fuels
* Dramatic growth is fostered by a policy framework established by the government
	* Petroleum shapes policy (technological momentum)

### The Resource Curse

* A country rich in a natural resource becomes more and more dependent on that resource
* Country is rich in a natural resource \textrightarrow{} developing it raises value of currency \textrightarrow{} higher currency disadvantages other exports/industries (exports cost more) \textrightarrow{} other industries close \textrightarrow{} cost of imported goods increase \textrightarrow{} country becomes even more dependent on that natural resource
	* Ultimately dependence on a single resource makes the country more vulnerable to market volatilities of that resource (especially oil)
* Hits Canada unevenly -- Alberta benefits from oil while Eastern provinces lose money

## Case Study: Natural Gas

* Requires extensive extraction and transportation system (fracking, pipelines, specialized storage & transportation)
* Projected demand to increase (from 24% of world energy mix)
* 18 proposed natural gas export facilities in Canada (but currently none)
* TC Energy is building the Coastal GasLink pipeline at a cost of \$11.2 billion
* BC offers subsidies totaling \$5.35 billion
* Local economic benefits:
	* 10000 people employed at peak construction, 500-900 permanent employees
	* Secondary economic benefit to local businesses
	* Broad support
* Provincial economic benefits:
	* Natural gas is to be shipped out when there is high demand -- if we don't sell ours, someone else will
	* Primary to Asian markets where coal electricity is commonly used, so ultimately this reduces GHG emissions
	* Royalties for the province to support products for the public good
