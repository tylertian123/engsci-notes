## Case Study: Natural Gas (Continued)

* Environmental risks:
	* Emissions (from compressors)
	* Ecological disturbance
	* Failure to clean up and reclaim sites
	* Energy for construction and maintenance
	* Pipeline and well leaks, blowouts and burn-offs
	* Storage, processing and shipping risks
	* Risks with fracking
* Currently under construction, but not everyone is happy
	* Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs are resisting

## Key Questions in Environmental Ethics

* Environment: natural world, as affect by human activity
* What is our ethical responsibility to the environment?
* What is the value and moral standing of the environment and its nonhuman actors?
* Is our responsibility ultimately to humans or to the environment itself?
* What is the value of an environmental actor when we take humans off the table?

## More-Than-Human Actors and Their Rights

* If we view ourselves as part of the environment, maybe environmental health means human health
* In traditional Western philosophy we look at the environment as something distinct, separate from us
	* Values are either instrumental or intrinsic
* "Part of the value that we get from the environment is the knowledge of how to take care of it"
