## Targeted Advertising

1. Tracking on-site activity, e.g. likes, ads, device and location, internet connection type
2. Activity on other websites, e.g. "your off-Facebook activity"
3. Works with publishers to cross-share visitors
4. Data from marketing agencies that have built profiles

* This results in better consumer experience, but is often problematic depending on the type of the product
	* e.g. Precious metal scheme targeting retired Republicans that fuel conspiracy theories and distrust, and caused people to lose money
* Even when policies are brought into place it can still be very difficult to make sure ads aren't getting through holes

## Predatory Micro-Targeting

* "Epistemic fragmentation": unlike big billboard ads that target lots of people at a time, which tend to be more moderate, targeted ads are an isolated experience
	* No opportunity to compare with others in a shared space
		* We can't look out for others since we don't know what ads they're getting
	* Targeted to the most receptive subset of people, so there are less complaints
* Programmatic advertising: automated buying and selling of ad space
	* If this is used for services such as gambling, it could be problematic
	* Vulnerable populations can be more easily exploited
* note: Third party cookies are no longer being supported
	* Google gets even more of an advertising share with Chrome tracking
* Trust with internal company controls -- examples of overreach and breach

## Smart Cities

* Data collected from various methods used to manage assets, resources and services, and improve operations across the city
* In the past we had sampled, occasional data (e.g. surveys), but big data is generated and processed in real time and is extensive
* City systems are more tightly interlinked and integrated, which makes them more vulnerable
* Promotes a "computational" understanding of city systems
* Privacy: to selectively reveal oneself to the world
	* Considered a basic human right in many jurisdictions, including a part of the UN UDHR
	* Types:
		* Identity privacy (personal data)
		* Bodily privacy (integrity of the physical person)
		* Territorial privacy (personal space and property)
		* Locational and movement
		* Communications
		* Transactions
