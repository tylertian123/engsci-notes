## Actor Network Theory Goals

* Goals: breaking the sociotechnical dualism (technology and society are not necessarily separate things), and making the invisible visible (technology is not just a gadget)
* Transitional approaches to the study of technology:
	* Technological determinism: Technology develops in a fixed sequence and imposes characteristics on society
		* Technology as a gadget -- there is something inherent to it that impacts society and individuals
		* Example: Zoom
			* Inherent traits: low cost of reproduction, non-rival (doesn't get used up), taps into a global network which affords it usability -- demands participation
			* Specific features: participant list, annotation, institutional account -- refuses anonymity
			* Mute feature -- refuses participant autonomy
			* Technological features of zoom influences the organization and relationships and activities of a class
	* Social construction of technology: Social groups shape technology
		* What matters is not technology itself, but the socioeconomic system it is embedded in
		* Example: Zoom
			* Grew from 10 to 200 million daily users in 3 months, based on human demand
			* Expanded to educational need (from mostly business), based on a human decision that was made
			* Broader set of users using technology in a myriad of ways
	* Technological momentum: Individuals and groups direct the development of new technologies, but investment in large sociotechnical systems makes them difficult to change
		* Initially society creates and influences technology as a gadget, but when it gets big it influences society and cannot be changed (except for innovation around the edges)
		* Reconciles TD and SCOT
		* Example: Teaching has always been the same; only limited innovation around the edges, e.g. better spaces like Myhal, mentimeter
	* Problems: Both TD and SCOT move only in one direction, doesn't acknowledge the interactions between the two; divides the social and technical
* Political: Arrangements of power and authority in human associations and the activities that take place within these arrangements

## Actor Network Theory

* ANT views technology as an actor within a web of actors; the interactions produce meaning
* Looks at structure, relationships, and power
* What shapes human choices? The structure/agency divide:
	* Structure: the arrangements in our society, material or cultural, shapes our choices
	* Agency: humans act independently, free choice
* ANT puts humans and nonhumans together in a series of relationships
	* Nonhuman actors can be conceptual or artifacts
* Everything is generated by the interactions between actors
* Any node in the network can be expanded into its own network
* Artifacts mediate interactions between humans
* Human actors are not prioritised over nonhuman actors (generalized symmetry)
	* For both, power is generated through the network itself
	* ANT alone is not an ethical analysis, but it can be used to analyze power relations that lead to ethics
* ANT is a method; it does not provide you with an answer
