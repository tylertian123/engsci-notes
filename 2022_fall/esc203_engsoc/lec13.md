## What is Equity?

* Acknowledgement of the barriers to equal opportunities and working to eliminate them
	* Equal opportunities doesn't mean equal outcomes
* "Diversity is a fact. Inclusion is a practice. Equity is a goal."
* "Who" is in scope? rather than "what" is in scope?

## Equity Theory

* The Four Propositions:
	1. People are hardwired to try to maximize their own pleasure and minimize pain
	2. Society has a vested interest in persuading people to behave fairly and equitably
		* Groups reward those who behave in ways that are appropriate and punish those that behave otherwise
	3. People are more comfortable when they perceive that they are profiting and getting what they deserve from a relationship
		* Over-benefiting from a relationship makes us uncomfortable (guilt, shame)
		* Under-benefiting makes us resent the relationship
	4. People in inequitable relationships will attempt to reduce their distress through a variety of techniques: restoring psychological equity, actual equity, or abandoning the relationship
* We can frame a situation as both over-benefiting and under-benefiting depending on your worldview

## Disaffordances and Dysaffordances

* Disaffordance: failure to recognize the needs of a group
* Dysaffordance: forcing a group to identify as something that they're not in order to use the technology
* Where do they come from?
	* Sometimes things are explicitly designed to be oppressive; however most of the time it's not the intention that's bad
	* Biases contribute to this
