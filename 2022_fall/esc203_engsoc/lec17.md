## Measures of Equity

1. Distribution of Wealth
	* Has problems -- it's hard to find wealth
2. Income Inequality
	* Gini coefficient: how unevenly income is distributed (how far are we from everyone having the same income?)
		* Complete equity is 0
	* Gap between mean and median income is widening
3. Social Mobility
	* Can you change your opportunity in life despite the situation you're born into?
	* Equality of opportunity, not outcome
	* Number of generations it takes for those born in a low-income family to approach mean income

* *Economic spread*: Large and growing differences among people in income, wealth, and other circumstances of life
	* These might not be the only part of quality of life, but this is still a key indicator
