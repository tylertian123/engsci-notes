## Ethics

* Branch of moral philosophy that addresses right and wrong actions
	* What is the best way for people to live?
	* What is right or wrong in a particular situation?
* Ethics can be codified e.g. religious texts
* Dilemmas are where ethical codes fail
* Morals are more personal concepts of right and wrong, whereas ethics define shared concept of right and wrong
	* Our moral foundations can shift due to changes in our worldview
		* Because they are about us, they are by definition subjective
		* "It does not mean unmalleable; it means organized in advance of experience"
		* Moral reasoning is always *post hoc* -- "We reason to find the best possible reasons why somebody else ought to join us in our judgement"
* Two distinctions in Ethics:
	1. The micro/macro distinction
		* Microethics focuses on issues relevant to individuals and relationships within the engineering profession (personal decision)
		* Macroethics focuses on the social responsibility and societal decisions about technology (collective decision)
	2. The relative/absolute distinction
* The engineering code is a document framed in terms of microethics

### Merit Goods

* Goods and services that should be accessible by all individuals in a society irrespective of their abilities
	* Individuals need them, and/or their universal coverage benefits society at large
* Decisions about merit goods involve macroethical decisions
* Ideals lead to principles to guide actions (absolute ethics)
	* Professional codes
	* Utilitarianism, duty ethics
	* A single account of the human good
	* Ethics as a universal aspiration
* On the other hand, situations can be compared to others' situations and actions to guide your own actions (relative ethics)
	* Relative to the aspirations of our culture
	* e.g. definition of success
	* Ethics as a social contract

## Virtues

* One of the approaches to ethics
* The best is always the midpoint between contrary extremes (e.g. courage lies between foolhardiness and cowardice)
