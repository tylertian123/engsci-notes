## Why Policy?

* Allows distribution of benefits and harm
* Climate and health costs (externalities) need to be accounted for
* There is no natural market incentive because emitters don't pay for the costs of emissions

## Key Policy Instruments

1. Feed-in-Tariff
	* Small scale clean energy producers are promised a higher price for heir output
	* Encourages small renewable enterprise
2. Carbon Pricing
	* Raises the cost of fossil fuels
	* Addresses externalities, but no control on total emissions
3. Carbon Permits
	* Emitters purchase permits for carbon emissions set by the government
	* Open market for permits
	* Very difficult to implement
	* Costs are passed onto the consumer

## Post-Sustainability Trilemma

* Neoliberalist ideas work resists change
* What if we can only have two of environmental protection, economic growth, and participatory government?
* Techno business-as-usual (growth + participation)
	* Neoliberal ideals
	* Environmental care depends on people's tastes, which may come too late
	* Incremental changes, not transformative policies
* Environmental authoritarianism (growth + environmental protection)
	* Democratic societies can't impose effective limits
	* A small group of decision makers is more effective
	* Drastic redefinition of what's public and what's private
	* However environmentalism and growth can become incompatible after easy efficiency fixes
* Post-growth (environmental protection + participation)
	* Curbs material desires and explores other means of flourishing
	* Requires a different way of framing and controlling the market
