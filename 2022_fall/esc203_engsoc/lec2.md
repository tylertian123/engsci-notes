## The Big Ideas

1. Science-Technology-Society Studies (STS)
	* Understanding the relationship between technological and social development
	* Influenced by the environment & civil rights movements (more critical nature)
	* Encourage critique of dominant ideologies
2. (Breaking the) Sociotechnical Dualism
	* Science and mathematics is understood to be the basis of engineering expertise, which gives it a false objectivity
3. Sitting with Discomfort

## Epistemology

* The philosophy of knowledge -- how do we know things?
* Positivism: knowledge is objective
	* Single truth
	* Scientific
	* It can be proved, or it can't
* Interpretivism: Knowledge is socially constructed
	* Changes with time, context, culture
	* Qualitative observations and discussion
* Highlights from Nightingale's *What Is Technology*:
	* Complex understanding of technology beyond the physics of the artefact
	* How we define and think about technology impacts how we evaluate it
	* The two pathologies:
		1. Technology as a gadget: it's a system of artefacts and knowledge; thinking of technology as a gadget misses all the indivisible infrastructure
		2. Technology as a way of seeing the world: if technology becomes second nature, we can mistake it for being natural
			* Postman's technology becoming mythic
