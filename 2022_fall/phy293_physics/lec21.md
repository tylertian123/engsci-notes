## X-Ray Diffraction

* X-rays are reflected from atoms in the crystalline structure of solids
* Reflected x-rays from different layers can interfere constructively or destructively, leading to a diffraction pattern
* Bragg's Law: $n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta$ leads to constructive interference, where $d$ is the spacing between layers of atoms
	* We can orient the crystal in different ways and get different values of $d$ to figure out the arrangement of atoms
	* This can also be used to determine $\lambda$ given known $\theta$ and $d$
* Powder diffraction: doing an effective average of all the $d$ distances by having tiny particles of the crystal as a powder, which lets us do all orientations at once

## Matter Waves

* de Broglie: if photons can behave like both a particle and a wave, can electrons?
* $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$ for photons, so can other matter act like waves?
* What if electrons around a Bohr model acted like standing waves?
	* From this assumption we can derive Bohr's quantization idea that $mvr = L = n\hbar$
* $\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE}}$ because $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m}$, for an electron this is about $1.23\si{\angstrom}$
* This idea was proven by doing diffraction on electrons
