## Multiple Coupled Oscillators

* For $N$ coupled masses we need to solve for the eigenvalues of an $N \times N$ matrix
* For a symmetrical system we can always factor out $\omega^2 - 2\frac{k}{m}$
* For a system of 3 oscillators, the frequencies are $\omega^2 = \frac{2k}{m}$ or $\frac{k}{m}\left(2 \pm \sqrt{2}\right)$

## Coupled Forced Oscillations

* Consider a system of coupled spring oscillators where the end is driven by $\xi(t) = \xi _0\cos(\omega t)$
	* The mass at the end gets an extra term, but the other masses have the same equation of motion
* It turns out we just get the regular driven oscillator, now with $x_A + x_B$ and $x_A - x_B$
	* Resonance occurs near any of the normal mode frequencies
	* When driving frequency is close to $\omega _1$ the masses oscillate in phase; when it's close to $\omega _2$ they oscillate out of phase
