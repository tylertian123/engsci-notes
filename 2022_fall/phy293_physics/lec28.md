## Potential Barrier

* If the potential step goes to 0 again we have a potential barrier
* $V(x) = \threecond{0}{x < 0}{V_0}{0 \leq x \leq a}{0}{x > a}$
* In the third region we have $\psi _{III} = Fe^{ikx}$ (note there is no $e^{-ikx}$ term since there will not be a wave moving to the left in this region)
* Inside the barrier $C = 0$ is no longer true because we can normalize it even with $C \neq 0$
* Calculate $R = \abs*{\frac{B}{A}}^2, T = \abs*{\frac{F}{A}}^2$
* After matching boundary conditions, $T = \frac{16E(V_0 - E)}{V_0^2}e^{-2\alpha a}$, assuming $V_0 \gg E$, where $\alpha^2 = \frac{2m(V_0 - E)}{\hbar^2}$
	* The expression for $T$ and $R$ in general are quite complicated, but if we take the limit $E \ll V_0$ then this simplifies
* The transmission coefficient is exponentially dependent on the barrier width and $\alpha$
	* The wider the barrier, the harder tunneling is
	* The larger the barrier height $V_0 - E$ or mass $m$, the harder tunneling is
* In general with a potential barrier for any shape we can break it up into potential steps and integrate

## Examples of Quantum Tunneling

* Field emission: consider electrons in a piece of metal in a vacuum;
