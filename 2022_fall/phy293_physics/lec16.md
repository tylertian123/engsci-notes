## Superposition of Waves

* Monochromatic waves have only one wavelength/frequency
* Waves can be superimposed
* Superimposing two waves creates beat phenomena
	* The wave is a multiplication of the two waves
	* The first wave has the average wave number and frequency
	* The second wave has $\frac{1}{2}(k_2 - k_1)$ and $\frac{1}{2}(\omega _2 - \omega _1)$
* The higher frequency makes the carrier frequency in the beat; the lower frequency makes the modulating frequency
	* The beat frequency is $\frac{1}{2}\abs{\omega _2 - \omega_1}$
* This is used in AM radio

\noteImportant{Although the beat frequency has $\omega = \frac{1}{2}(\omega _2 - \omega _1)$, the frequency we hear is effectively twice this amount, at $\omega _2 - \omega _1$}

## Dispersion

* What happens when not al l the waves travel with the same frequency?
* In dispersive media, $v$ and $\omega$ are functions of $k$, and wave speed depends on frequency
* A pulse, made of a superposition of waves, spreads out as it travels as the different components travel at different speeds
* The relation $\omega(k)$ is the *dispersion relation*
* This can be seen in e.g. prisms where in a dispersive medium, the refractive index for different wavelengths is different
* Phase velocity is defined as $v = \frac{\omega _0}{k_0}$, the ratio of the average frequency and wave number
	* The phase velocity is how fast a disturbance travels
	* The velocity of the carrier wave
* Group velocity is defined as $v_g = \frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta k} = \frac{\omega(k_2) - \omega(k_1)}{k_2 - k_1}$
	* The group velocity is how fast the envelope travels
	* The velocity of the modulating wave
	* $v_g = \eval{\diff{\omega}{k}}{k = k_0}$
	* $v_g = v - \lambda\diff{v}{\lambda}$
