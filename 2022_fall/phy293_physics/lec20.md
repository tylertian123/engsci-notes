## Spectroscopy and Bohr's Model

* Burning stuff to see what colour it emits
* First there was Thomson's plum pudding model, then it was discovered that atoms are mostly empty space, so came Rutherford's model of electrons orbiting a nucleus
	* However the orbiting electrons should emit radiation, which causes them to lose energy and spiral into the nucleus with a lifetime of $\SI{10e-8}{s}$
* Bohr's model had some assumptions:
	1. Electrons are in a circular orbit (Rutherford model)
	2. The electrons are in stationary states/orbits, i.e. they don't radiate energy
	3. Radiation is emitted when electrons change orbits
* Bohr assumed angular momentum is quantized $L = mvr = n\hbar$ where $n$ is a positive integer and $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$ is the reduced Planck constant
* To solve for the energy of the electron, equate the centripetal force with the Coulomb force:
	* $F_{cent} = m\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{ke^2}r^2 = F_{Coulomb}$
	* $k\frac{e^2}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} \implies ke^2 = (mvr)v = Lv = n\hbar v$
	* This gives: $v = \frac{ke^2}{n\hbar}, r = \frac{(n\hbar)^2}{kme^2}$
