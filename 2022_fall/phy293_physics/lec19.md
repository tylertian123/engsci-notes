## Photoelectric Effect

* Ultraviolet light causes metals to release electrons; electron energy does not depend on light intensity, but increases with frequency
	* The dependence of electron energy on frequency is unknown
* Einstein proposed the quantization of light, from Planck: $E_{max} = \frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = hf - \phi$
	* This predicts that $E_{max} = eV_0$ is linear in $f$, with slope of $h$
	* These predictions were confirmed by Millikan
* Einstein quantized light in *photons*, but nobody accepted it at first even after the Millikan experiment

## Compton's Experiment

* This is the experiment that made physicists accept photons
* Investigates what happens when light is shined at electrons
* In the classical picture, since light is the oscillation of an electric field, an electron will oscillate inside this field as light passes through; this oscillating charge will radiate out light at the same frequency
	* This is *Thompson Scattering*, where $\lambda = \lambda'$
* In the quantum picture, since light is a particle, when the photon collides with the electron both the photon and electron will change course based like in a classical collision experiment
	* Collision can be elastic or inelastic, i.e. $\lambda$ of the photon can change to $\lambda'$ as it loses energy, which is gained by the electron
	* This is *Compton Scattering*, when $\lambda \neq \lambda'$ is possible
* $E = hf \implies p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{hf}{c} = \frac{h}{\lambda}$
	* Consider photon coming in with $E_0, \vec p_0$ hitting an electron with rest energy $mc^2$
	* The electron goes out with $\vec p_2$, photon goes out with $(E_0, \vec p_1)$, with angle change $\theta$
	* Momentum and energy conservation: $\vec p_0 = \vec p_1 + \vec p_2, E_0 + mc^2 = E_1 + \sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + (\vec p_2c)^2}$
		* $\sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + (\vec p_2c)^2}$ is the relativistic electron energy (don't worry about this right now)
	* This gives $\lambda _0 - \lambda _1 = \frac{h}{mc}(1 - \cos \theta)$
		* $\frac{h}{mc}$ is a length scale, referred to as the *Compton wavelength*, $0.0242\si{\angstrom}$
		* Since this change is very small, to notice the change we need to start with a very small $\lambda _0$, so X-rays are used
* Results from Compton's experiment confirmed the quantum picture, which made people accept the existence of photons
