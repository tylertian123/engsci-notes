## Buoyancy and Archimedes' Principle

* Buoyant force is caused by the increase of pressure with depth
* Parts of an object that are submerged deeper experience higher pressure, which gives a net upward force

\noteThm{Archimedes' Principle: The buoyant force acting on a submerged body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the solid body, acting in the direction opposite to gravity: $$\vec F_B = \rho _\text{fluid}gV\vec k$$}

* Note that the buoyant force is independent of the density of the object or how deep it is
* For any solid submerged object, consider a region of fluid in the same shape; the region of fluid is in static equilibrium, so its buoyant force should be equal to its weight
	* The buoyant force of the fluid is the same as that of the solid body since they have the same volume
	* Therefore the buoyant force on the object is the same as the weight of the fluid displaced
* For a floating body, the buoyant force caused by the submerged region is in balance with the weight of the body
* If $\rho _b < \rho _f$, the body floats because a partially submerged body displaces more weight of the fluid than the weight of the body
* If $\rho _b = \rho _f$, the body is neutrally buoyant and will be suspended in the fluid
* If $\rho _b > \rho _f$, the body sinks because the buoyant force never matches the weight of the body, even when the entire body is submerged
* Note the buoyant force is proportional to the fluid density, so buoyant forces in gases are usually negligible
