* Ideal gas law: $PV = NR_uT$
	* $R_u = 8.314\si{J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1}}$ or $\si{m^3.Pa.mol^{-1}K^{-1}}$ is the universal ideal gas constant
	* For different gases $R = \frac{R_u}{M_w}$ where $M_w$ is molecular weight, so $PV = mRT$
		* Values of $R$ can be found in Appendix 1 of the textbook
	* Air can be approximated by $78\%\ce{N2}, 22\%\ce{O2}$
* Ideal gas law assumes the molecules within the gas have no interactions with each other
* Ideal gas law is a good approximation when the gas is *diluted*
