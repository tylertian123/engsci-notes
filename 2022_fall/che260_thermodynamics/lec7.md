## Converting Heat into Work

* Every gas has internal energy, so can we use the air to do work?
* Can we take $Q$ from the air and convert this into $W$?
	* This does satisfy energy conservation
	* Of course, this is not possible, so why?
* A heat engine involves a heat source $T_H$, transferring heat $Q_H$ to a gas to expand it, pushing a piston up
	* The engine stops when the temperature of the gas $T$ reaches $T_H$
	* If we want the engine to do work again, we have to cool the gas, which requires a heat sink $T_C$
* As a consequence:
	1. To increase work, increase $T_H$
	2. In the limit $T_H \to T_C$, no work is done
	3. We always need 2 temperatures
* This implies that there is a "quality" of energy -- just because something has internal energy, doesn't mean we can actually do useful work with it
	* The higher the temperature, the more work we can get out of it
* Can we define a property that measure this?
	* This would require some combination of the amount of energy and the temperature

## Entropy and the Second Law

\noteDefn{The fundamental property entropy $S$, where $\dS = \frac{\delta Q}{T}$, with units of $\si{J/K}$}

* Entropy is an extensive property that changes when heat is added or remove from a system
* The entropy change is the ratio of the heat added and the temperature at which it was added
	* If $\delta Q$ is added to a system, then $T$ is the temperature of the boundary where the heat crossed
	* An increase in temperature decreases the entropy change
* Assume no work done so $\dd U = \delta Q$, then the entropy change $\dS = \frac{\delta Q}{T}$
* $\Delta S = \int _1^2 \,\dS = \int _1^2 \frac{\delta Q}{T}$

\noteDefn{A thermal reservoir is a system whose temperature remains constant, even when heat is added or taken from it (think of a very large thermal mass, e.g. the air, a lake, etc)}

* For a thermal reservoir, $\Delta S = \int _1^2 \frac{\delta Q}{T} = \frac{1}{T}\int _1^2 \delta Q = \frac{Q_{12}}{T}$
* Consider two thermal reservoirs $A$ with $T + \Delta T$ and $B$ with $T$ (assume $\Delta T > 0$); bring them together and let them exchange heat
	* $\Delta S_A = \frac{Q}{T + \Delta T}$
	* $\Delta S_B = \frac{Q}{T}$
	* $\Delta S_B$ is greater in magnitude, so the total entropy increases (entropy generated is $S_{gen} = \abs{\Delta S_B} - \abs{\Delta S_A}$)
	* Note $\Delta T \to 0, \implies S_{gen} \to 0$
* Energy is conserved, but entropy can be generated
	* Entropy is generated when heat transfer occurs between two thermal reservoirs whose temperatures differ by a finite amount
	* All real heat transfer processes generate entropy
* Entropy cannot be destroyed, as that would involve a heat transfer from a lower temperature to a higher temperature
* Consider an isolated system not in equilibrium (system contains cold gas, and a little pocket of hot gas)
	* When the system goes to equilibrium, the heat from the hot pocket goes to the rest of the gas, so the entropy increases
* Doing work on a system does not change its entropy

\noteDefn{The Second Law of Thermodynamics: The entropy an isolated system will increase until the system reaches equilibrium; the entropy of an isolated system remains constant \tcblower $\dS_{isolated} > 0$ when not in equilibrium; $\dS_{isolated} = 0$ when in equilibrium; $\dS_{isolated} < 0$ is impossible}

* The second law defines what things happen spontaneously
* Example: a ball can be dropped and have its PE be lost to heat, but a ball on the ground can never spontaneously gain PE from the environment and lift up
	* If the ball spontaneously jumps into the air, heat has to be taken from the air, which decreases the entropy, violating the second law

## Real Processes

* Real processes always produce entropy
* Consider a force pulling up a mass $F = mg$ at equilibrium
	* If we increase the force to $F + \Delta F$ in the limit as $\Delta F \to 0$, this would be a quasi equilibrium process and the mass is lifted up
	* If we reverse this process and make $\Delta F$ negative, then we can recover all the energy
	* For this reason the process is called *reversible*

\noteDefn{Reversible process: Both the system and its surroundings can be put back into the initial state}

* In a real system, heat is generated by friction in the pulley
	* $Q$ is transferred to the surroundings, so the entropy of the surroundings increases
	* Even if the mass is lowered back, the entropy of the surroundings cannot be lowered again

\noteDefn{Isentropic process: Quasi-equilibrium processes (reversible) without heat transfer or generation of entropy}
