## Concepts and Definitions

* System: any piece of matter or region of space
	* The system is separated from the surroundings by a boundary
	* The surroundings is everything that's not the system
* Types of systems:
	* Open system/control volume: mass and energy can flow freely in and out of the system
	* Closed system/control mass: the amount of mass in the system is fixed, but energy can still cross the boundary
		* Example: A pipe open on both sides
	* Isolated system: no mass or energy crosses the system boundaries
* Property (state variable): any attribute of a system that can be measured without knowing the history of the system
	* Example: position is a property, but work is not a property since it depends on the path taken
	* For properties, infinitesimal changes are denoted by $\dd$, otherwise they are denoted by $\delta$ (e.g. $\dx, \delta W$)
	* Temperature is a property, but heat is not
	* Anything that crosses the system boundary is not a property (e.g. even though mass is a boundary, mass introduced to an open system is $\delta m$)
* Steady state: all properties of a system do not change with time
	* Note the system may be interacting with the surroundings (e.g. a container that is being filled and drained of water at the same rate)
* Equilibrium: when an isolated system is in steady state
	* All isolated systems tend towards equilibrium, where all properties are constant and uniform
* Quasi-equilibrium process (reversible process): when all the parts of a system are in equilibrium all the time during a process
	* e.g. pushing a piston to compress a gas, doing so infinitely slowly so that the pressure in the gas is always uniform
	* A quasi-equilibrium process does the minimum amount of work (and also gets the most work out of a system)
* Pressure, volume and temperature are related by the ideal gas law $PV = nR_uT$
	* Note $P$ is the absolute pressure, which is equal to the gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure
