## Market Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning

* Mass marketing has economies of scale, but targeted marketing is often much more effective
* *Segmentation* is the process of dividing the market into distinct groups, so each group has homogeneous needs, characteristics or behaviours that allow targeting the whole group
	* This enables focused strategies (choosing the niche(s) to market to)
	* Segmentation allows companies to identify smaller, better defined target groups, understand key customer needs and wants, and reach customers more effectively
* *Targeting* is the process of choosing which group to market to
* *Positioning* is the process of creating a clear, distinctive, and desirable position in the target customer's mind, that stands out from the competition
	* If a company has a single product, this is basically strategic positioning, but for multiple products every product needs to have its own position

### Segmentation and Targeting

* 5 steps to segmentation and targeting:
	1. Grouping potential buyers into segments
		* Commonly this is done over the 4 variables:
			* Geographic: country/region, urban/rural, neighbourhood, climate, etc
			* Demographic: ethnic background, age, gender, income, family size
			* Psychographic: lifestyle and personality (e.g. outdoors/active people vs. indoors people)
			* Behavioural: when, why, and how they buy or use the product (e.g. power users vs. casual users)
		* Variables are often bundled together to describe a profile
		* Choose 3-6 distinct segments for the marketing plan assignment
	2. Grouping products to be sold into each category
		* e.g. business vs. commercial offerings, different categories within them, and then specific products
		* Group products into a tree, based on the market segments
	3. Developing a market-product grid and estimate the size of markets
		* Use a grid that has products on one axis and segments on the other axis to assess how attractive each product is to each segment (how many customers, revenue per customer)
		* This also involves understanding the characteristics of each segment
	4. Selecting target markets
		* Factors to consider:
			* Expected financial performance (segment size, growth, purchasing power, profitability)
			* Competitive positioning (must be competitive in the segment now and over time)
			* Accessibility (cost of delivering to the segment)
			* Fit with the organization's R&Cs (being able to deliver an effective marketing program)
	5. Take marketing actions to reach those markets
		* Using the 4Ps (product, price, place, promotion)

### Positioning

* The point of positioning is to be differentiated from the competition -- occupying a unique position in the consumer's mind on important attributes
	* It's always about the perception of the differences, not as much the actual physical differences -- all value is perceived
* Positions are based on important perceived attributes, e.g. for soap, we can position based on attributes such as degree of moisturizing and deodorant properties
* There are generally 2 ways to do positioning:
	* Head-to-head positioning: comparing directly to rivals ("we are the best in x")
	* Differentiation positing: stressing the important attributes ("we are different"), e.g. Coors' cold-activated labels
* *Repositioning* is changing the consumer's perception of a product, which is often much harder than initial positioning
	* Challenges stemming from high advertising costs to change ingrained customer beliefs or customer confusion about the brand image
		* Consumers might not buy your claims if e.g. you move from a low-cost product to a high-quality one
		* Could create a new brand name to differentiate from other (previous) offerings
	* Need to choose a target in the market to go to (identify a market gap), and a message to send to the customers
		* Strategic group map and market segmentation can inform this
		* However, just because there is a market gap, doesn't mean it is profitable (it might just not be possible to do, or customers might not want it)
* Why reposition?
	* Reacting to competition
	* Reaching new markets
	* Catching a rising trend
	* Changing the value added
		* Trading down (reducing features/quality) or trading up (increasing features/quality)

### B2B Marketing

* For B2B, there are several more layers of risk, since the demand for your product is dependent on the demand for your buyer's product
* It's common to have a few dominant customers and long-term relationships
* Organizations tend to be risk-averse and so harder to introduce new products to
* Organizations also have a 5 step purchase decision process, but the details are different
	1. Problem recognition: triggered by in-depth knowledge of industry, often have existing suppliers that prove to be insufficient
	2. Information search: specs are developed by engineers, a lot more stakeholders involved
	3. Evaluation of alternatives: bids are requested, price, quality, delivery and reliability are highly prized
	4. Purchase decision: lengthy negotiation and approval processes
	5. Post-purchase behaviour: formal post-purchase evaluation, ongoing supplier performance monitoring
* Segmentation is based on needs, behaviours, and firmographics/geographic (size, region, etc)
* To be successful, understand the purchasing organization's needs and the buying process well (how to get on the right bidding list, who is the most influential in the buying process)
