## Strategy

* *Strategy* is the competitive moves and business approaches used to run a company, and how those moves should deliver competitive advantage and superior performance
* Main questions to ask:
	1. Where are we now? (External and internal situation analysis)
		* e.g. Tesla has a huge market cap, rapidly growing revenue and profits
	2. Where do we want to go? (Long-term direction, customers, target markets)
		* Consider mission/vision statements, emerging competitors, etc
		* e.g. Tesla's goal is to internationalize while maintaining competitive advantage over emerging competitors
	3. How will we get there?
		* e.g. Tesla is shifting from focused differentiation (high-end EVs) to a "best-cost" strategy similar to other long-term dominant players, e.g. Toyota, so they are dropping prices
		* e.g. Tesla is also extending into complementary industries like autonomous driving and energy production and storage
* The goal is always to achieve long-term "performance", which is usually profits, but often can be revenue, valuation, etc.

\noteDefn{A firm has a \textit{competitive advantage} if it can sell its products/services for more than what they cost, and the gap is wider than what its competitors have achieved. The competitive advantage is \textit{sustainable} if it cannot be easily matched by competitors.}

* A sustainable competitive advantage is developed when a sufficiently large number of byers prefer a company's products/services over competitors, and this preference persists over time and generates long-term profits
* To develop a sustainable competitive advantage a company can:
	1. Develop a cost-based advantage (e.g. Walmart)
	2. Develop a differentiation-based advantage (e.g. Lululemon)
	3. Focus on a narrow market niche (e.g. Canada Goose)
* Strategy has to evolve constantly as the market changes -- this is a cyclical process
	* Failure to adapt strategy to market changes can destroy a company, e.g. Nokia
* Actual realized strategies are often different from planned strategies
* Viable strategies require a viable *business model*:
	1. Compelling value proposition (preferable products/services compared to rivals)
	2. Favourable economics (profitability)
	3. Superior execution (being able to deliver the value proposition better than the competition)
