## Commercialization

### Intellectual Property Protection

* A *patent* is a legal right to prevent others from making, using, or selling your invention for up to 20 years (in North America) in the country or region where your patent is granted
	* Patents can be sold, licensed, used as assets, etc
	* Patentable inventions should be novel, useful, and non-obvious
* IP protection exists to protect inventions and provide an incentive for innovation, as otherwise people will just wait for others to innovate first and copy their invention -- it strengthens the first-mover advantage
* The process of getting and protecting a patent is expensive in both money and time, and can take several years
* To be granted a patent, the invention has to be disclosed in detail in the application, so once the patent expires others can replicate the invention
	* Sometimes firms may choose not to pursue a patent due to this reason
* Firms often combine legal IPP with strategic IPP to create intangible entry barriers
	* Barriers can include trade secrets, scarce resources, network effects, building in switching costs, developing a strong reputation, and building strong R&D capabilities
	* Main components can be patented, while specific ingredients etc can be kept as trade secrets
	* e.g. Coca-Cola did not patent their recipe, instead kept as a trade secret to build the brand image and prevent others from copying even after 20 years

### Entrepreneurial Strategy

* Securing IP protection is often the first order of business to secure a VRIN resource
* The "monthly burn rate" of a startup is the amount of money a startup needs to pay out each month
* When to disrupt an existing industry (i.e. compete with incumbents) vs cooperating with existing firms (i.e. licensing your technology)? Or compete and then get acquired by incumbents?
* The firm can license the technology to incumbents to offload all the risks and developmental costs
	* This can be beneficial when the firm doesn't have resources to bring the technology to market, or when you want to bring the technology to market the fastest (e.g. in a standards race), which stops other firms from R&D and patenting their own technology
	* The firm can focus on R&D efforts which can keep them strong in R&D and moving fast
	* Beneficial only when the firm has a strong technological advantage, and can protect it with strong IPP
	* This results in a strong dependence on other firms for market success
	* Often established firms have much stronger bargaining power, so this may result in being locked into a bad deal that limits growth (e.g. exclusive licensing contracts)
* Qualcomm is a very successful example of licensing a standard; they charge an upfront licensing fee and a percentage of the wholesale price of every device, resulting in massive revenue
	* Upfront licensing fees can be very helpful for startups with no established revenue streams ("extend the runway")
* The firm can choose to directly compete with incumbents if it has the R&Cs to bring the product to market effectively, or have something that will completer transform the market
	* This comes with all the usual risks of being a first mover
	* Effort spent on bringing the product to market can make the firm lag behind in R&D and lose nimbleness and speed
* Generally it's very difficult to match to R&Cs of existing firms; effective strategies should leverage the advantages of new firms
	* Emphasize speed for lead time advantage, and set up intangible entry barriers
	* Emphasize selective focus, clearly defining a target market/niche and partners/channels/suppliers to set yourself apart from incumbents
	* Allow for experimentation to test your hypotheses cheaply and quickly; rent, borrow, or share resources
* When deciding on the entrepreneurial strategy, consider:
	* Where you see the future of your company -- R&D or end market? Maximizing financial payout or mission-driven?
	* Stability of the industry/technology/market -- how quickly is it changing?
	* Your value to other players in the ecosystem -- where in the value chain do you fit in? Are you trying to create an entirely new value chain?
	* Potential for IP protection (particularly important for licensing)
* From the incumbent's perspective, what can the firm do to avoid being disrupted?
	* Change is problematic for incumbents as they might not see growth potential until it's too late to adapt, or they might be locked into a structure that makes it difficult or impossible to adapt (e.g. Netflix vs Blockbuster, or Kodak inventing the digital camera but not being able to capitalize on it)
	* Incumbents should leverage existing R&Cs and customer/distributor/partner relationships
	* Structure the company in a way such that new ideas can be easily integrated
	* With a suitable structure, disruptions can be avoided simply by buying successful disruptors, e.g. Facebook buying up Instagram
