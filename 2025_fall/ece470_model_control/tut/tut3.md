* Consider $R_2^1 = \matthree{0}{0}{1}{0}{-1}{0}{1}{0}{0}$; express this as a sequence of elementary rotations
	* By drawing out the coordinate frames and inspection, this can be decomposed into a rotation about $y_1$ by $\pi/2$ followed by a rotation about $z_*$ by $\pi$ where $*$ denotes the intermediate frame
