* *Postulate of Space*: physical space is represented by a 3-dimensional Euclidean space
* *Particle*: a quantity of matter that occupies an infinitesimal volume
* *Postulate of Time*: there exists the dimension of time, same regardless of space, and a particle can only be in one position at one time; changes in position are continuous in space and time
* *Law of Inertia*: there exists a frame of reference in which an isolated particle moves in a straight line in any direction (note we don't yet say the motion is uniform)
	* Such frames where the Law of Inertia holds are *inertial reference frames*
	* *Mach's Principle*: a local inertial frame is determined by all the matter in the universe and its distribution
* An isolated particle in an inertial reference frame moves equal intervals of distance in equal intervals of time; this is how we will define a graduation of time
* *Law of Action and Reaction*: the accelerations of two isolated particles in an inertial reference frame are in mutually opposite directions and the ratio of their magnitudes is constant
	* This allows us to define *ratio of masses* $m_i$ to $m_j$ is such that $m_ia_i = -m_ja_j$, but not absolute mass directly
* *Postulate of the Transitivity of Mass*: for any 3 particles, $\mu _{ij}\mu _{jk}\mu _{ki} = 1$ where $\mu _{ij}$ is the ratio of the mass of particle $i$ to $j$
* *Total Force*: the total force $\uvec f$ on a particle of mass $m$ is $\uvec f = m\uvec a$
	* The *individual force* comes only from a single agent
	* Newton's second law becomes a definition for force
	* *Law of Superposition of Forces*: the total force on a particle is the vector sum of the individual forces
