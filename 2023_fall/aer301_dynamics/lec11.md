## Orbital Motion and Gravity

* Kepler's laws:
	1. The orbits of planets are ellipses with the sun at one focus
	2. An orbiting planet sweeps out an equal area in equal time, i.e. $\diff{A}{t} = c$
	3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the mean distance from the sun, i.e. $T^2 \propto a^3$
* Kepler tells us the shape of the orbits without need for epicycles, but still does not tell us the fundamental force that causes such motion
* Newton's law of gravitation: $\uvec f_b^a = \frac{Gm_am_b}{r_3}\uvec r_b^a$ where $G = \SI{6.67e-11}{N.m^2.kg^{-2}}$ is the universal gravitation constant
	1. The force of gravity is central
	2. The force of gravity varies according to the inverse-square law
	3. The force of gravity is universal
* Kepler's second law can be derived directly from the fact that gravity is a central force
* Kepler's third law implies that this central force varies according to the inverse square law
* The universality of gravity can be determined by comparing the acceleration of an object on earth to the acceleration of the moon, after taking into account the inverse square law
* Inside a hollow shell, there is no gravitational force due to the inverse square law
* Inside a solid sphere, the gravitational force varies proportional to $r$ (since the mass varies as $r^3$ and the gravitational force varies as $r^{-2}$)
	* This means if we dug a hole through the earth and dropped a particle, it would exhibit simple harmonic motion, since the force is proportional to distance from the core
