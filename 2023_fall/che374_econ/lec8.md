## Introduction to Accounting

* Two broad categories of accounting:
	* Managerial accounting: focused on internal use for decision makers, future oriented
	* Financial accounting: focused on external use by investors and government, typically must conform to standards
* Businesses are organized into 3 types:
	* Proprietorship: single person owns the entire business, who takes all liability
	* Partnership: two or more people own the business, who share the liability
	* Corporation: shareholders own the business, run by a board of directors elected by shareholders
* Accountants follow *generally accepted accounting principles*, or GAAP, a set of professional guidelines
* Main accounting principles:
	1. Entity concept
	2. Relevance characteristic
	3. Reliability/objectivity principle
	4. Cost principle
	5. Going-concern concept
	6. Stable monetary unit concept
* A *financial statement* is financial information about a business prepared in a systematic format; consists of:
	* Income statement: presents sales and expenses over time
	* Balance sheet: provides a snapshot summary of the company's account
		* The income statement takes us from the balance sheet from one point in time to another
		* Balance sheet units are dollars, income statement units are dollars per time
	* Statement of cash flow: summarizes the company's use of cash (can be derived from the income statement and balance sheet)
	* Statement of retained earnings: information about a firm's retained earnings, net income, amount distributed to stockholders
* There are 5 primary *accounts*:
	* On the balance sheet: assets = liabilities + equity
		* These are permanent
		* Assets: things the business has that it uses to make money
			* Short term current assets, e.g. cash, accounts receivable, inventory, etc
			* Long term assets, e.g. land, buildings, equipment
		* Liabilities: debts of the company
			* e.g. bank loans, notes payable, accounts payable, etc
			* Current liabilities are ones due within a year, long-term liabilities are due more than a year out
		* Equity: owners' claims to the assets of a corporation
			* Includes historic money invested and retained earnings
	* On the income statement: net income = revenues - expenses
		* These are temporary, closed at the end of a period and transferred to the balance sheet
* During each period, we take the retained earnings from the start, add the net income, subtract dividends, and get the ending balance of retained earnings
* *Transactions* are events that affect the accounts
* *Accrual accounting* means to record transaction when they occur, not when the cash is actually exchanged; this is opposed to *cash basis* accounting, where transactions are recorded when the cash is exchanged
	* Generally the first is much more useful to us

### Double-Entry Accounting

* Each transaction has associated with it a *debit* and a *credit*
* Some accounts are "left hand side" accounts while some are "right hand side" accounts
	* Debits are increases to the left hand side while credits are increase to the right hand side
* Assets are on the left, while liabilities and equity are on the right
	* The retained earnings account (equity) increases with revenue, so revenue is considered a right hand side account
	* Expenses are considered a left hand side account
* Example: an owner of the business invests \$50000 cash in the business
	* This cash goes into assets, so we increase assets by \$50000; assets is a left hand side account so this is a debit
	* The associated credit is an increase in the common shares account, which is an equity account (right hand side)

### Financial Ratios

* Financial ratios are a quick and dirty way for us to value a business
* These can be used as metrics to compare similar companies or against the industry average, typically within the same industry
	* Cross industry comparison is typically not done
* There are 5 types:
	1. Liquidity ratios: ability to pay current liabilities
		* Defined as current assets divided by current liabilities
		* Higher numbers are better, and a ratio below 1 could be a sign of distress
		* The acid-test ratio shows the ability to pay liabilities if they are due immediately
			* This is the ratio of (cash + short-term investments + net current receivables) to liabilities
	2. Efficiency ratios: ability to sell inventory and collect receivables
		* The inventory turnover ratio is the cost of goods sold to average inverter
		* This is a measure of the number of times that we would sell the average inventory in a given year
			* Note that if we change the time period in question, we have to adjust accordingly
		* Larger companies are generally less efficient on this front -- lower inventory turnover ratio means more money is tied up in inventory
		* We can also measure this by days' inventory, the ratio of average inventory to average cost of goods sold in a day
			* This is the inverse of inventory turnover multiplied by the number of days in the period being analyzed
		* Accounts receivable turnover is the ratio of net credit sales to the average net accounts payable
		* Days' receivables is the ratio of average receivables to average sales per day
			* This is on average how many days it takes to receive money from customers
	3. Leverage ratios: ability to pay long-term debt
		* The debt ratio is the ratio of total liabilities to total assets (the proportion of assets financed with debt)
		* Times-interest-earned is the ratio of income from operations (sometimes EBIT) to the interest expense in the same period
			* This is how many times our income can cover the interest expense
	4. Profitability ratios
		* The profit margin is the ratio of net income to net sales (i.e. how much profit we make off of every dollar in sales)
		* Return on assets (ROA) measures how profitably the company uses its assets; usually calculated as net income to assets
			* This is the ratio of income to how much was invested in the company
			* Sometimes calculated as (net income + interest times 1 minus taxes) over assets
		* Return on equity (ROE) is ROA but uses equity instead of all assets
		* Earnings per share (EPS) is the amount of profit on a per-share basis; this is the ratio of net income to number of shares
	5. Performance ratios: analysis of shares as an investment
		* The price to earnings (P/E) ratio is the ratio of share price to earnings per share
			* A high P/E ratio could mean that the stock is overvalued, or that high growth is expected
			* This is not used for companies with zero or negative earnings
			* Note that a company with more debt would have a higher P/E ratio than an equivalent company with less debt
		* Dividend yield is the ratio of dividend per share to price per share
			* Mature and stable companies tend to pay dividends, while high growth companies tend to not pay dividends and instead reinvest the money
		* Market capitalization is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock (not a ratio)
			* Companies are categorized by size by market capitalization: large-cap (10B+), mid-cap (2B to 10B), small-cap (300M to 2B)
