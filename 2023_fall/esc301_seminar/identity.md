Graduate engsci --> work in industry --> settle down with family --> return to academia (if necessary) --> go back to industry --> retire --> move to Newfoundland

* I find the ideas presented to be very valid and in agreement with my personal experiences
* I don't like the trial and error aspect of it -- life is short and work is hard, so why do we have to spend so much time trying to find something socially meaningful?
* I would be very sad if engineering (science) turns out to not be meaningful for me down the line
