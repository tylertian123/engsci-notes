## Prototyping

* Prototyping: A model whose purpose is to generate or communicate information about **a design concept**
* Types of prototype:
	1. Functional prototype: Communicate specifically how one or more of its elements **accomplishes a task**
		* Does not have to have everything, can simply show one feature
	2. Scale prototype: Will this fit? Communicate specifically the size, orientation, organization, etc
	3. Graphical prototype: Communicate through the medium of drawings, sketches, renderings, etc
	4. Mathematical prototype: Ensure designs are feasible using math
	5. Simulation prototype: How does it behave over time?
* Questions to ask:
	* What information is it intended to communicate?
	* What information is it intended to generate?
	* What aspects of the design concept is it focusing on?
	* How does it integrate with all of the other prototypes?
* Prototype the stuff that's the most unbelievable/does not already exist
	* Consider your audience but don't give them too much credit for prior knowledge
* Prototypes are for others *and* yourself (**build to think**); answer your own questions
* Prototypes don't have to be perfect or look good or be complete; focus on the critical parts
* Prototypes crystallize your thinking and express ideas effectively, even if the prototype is very crude
	* Use representations to enable progress
