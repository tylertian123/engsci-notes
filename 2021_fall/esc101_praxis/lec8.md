## Framing

* Framing takes us from the situation and stakeholders to opportunity expressed in requirements (the world as it is to the world as we represent it)
* The processing of framing:
	1. Stakeholder Analysis
		* *Stakeholder*: An individual, group of people, organization or other entity that has a direct or indirect interest (or stake) in a system (could be advantaged or disadvantaged)
		* Stakeholders are major sources for requirements
		* Engaging with stakeholders:
			* Asking them questions and interviewing them, or simply observing how they behave
			* Codes/standards that you incorporate used to engage them
			* By engaging with stakeholders, we can validate our understanding of their interests
		* There are many ways to explore and clarify intentions, and handbooks are a good way to do this
		* Some stakeholders cannot directly express their interest, e.g. pets or the environment, and they're often disadvantaged; we have to interpret their interest through research and engagement
		* Model:
			* Perceive \textrightarrow Interpret \textrightarrow Assess \textrightarrow Act
			* Interpret: Apply models and possible meanings
			* Assess: Determine the most appropriate interpretation
			* Need to check our interpretations to make sure they accurately reflect the interests of the stakeholder
		* Scoping defines the boundaries of what is and what is not in consideration
			* The bigger the scope, the more complex your requirements, so getting the right scope is important
