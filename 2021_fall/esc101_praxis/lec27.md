## Gathering Data

1. Conduct research:
	* Selection-style embodiment design decisions (reference designs, key features)
	* Determining the feasibility and whether the technology exists already
	* Critical metrics from research:
		* Material properties (mechanical, chemical, etc)
		* Production cost
2. Perform calculations:
	* Decisions that you can answer with your civ or physics knowledge
	* Deformation, bending, loading, response
	* These things cannot be tested because we do not have access to the variables
3. Develop and test prototypes using protocols
	* Proxy testing!

## Proxy Testing

* Make sure you have a consistent and repeatable test protocol
* Prototypes are the input to a measurement process that produces a measurement that can be used for comparison
* Conducting tests:
	1. Determine the characteristic you wan to assess
	2. Look up standards about how to run these tests
	3. Develop a proxy test protocol that works for what you have
	4. Conduct your tests and gather comparable data
		* You don't need standard units, as long as the measurements enable comparison it's good enough
