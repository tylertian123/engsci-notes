## The Role of Research

* Standards from secondary research allows you to find a process and refine an objective, so primary research such as tests make sense
	* e.g. research pen standards so we know how to test a pen
* The research process:
	1. Start with a useful database, e.g. Google Scholar (not just Google!), and a rough search term
	2. Use findings to learn more
	3. Use more refined (specific or general) terms to find better things and learn even more
	4. Use the library for articles behind paywalls
* Evaluating sources: CRAAP test
	* Currency: The timeliness of the information
		* When was it published? Has it been revised?
	* Relevance: The importance of the information for you needs
	* Authority: Where does the information come from?
		* How credible is the source itself and the people who produced the source? Is it peer reviewed?
	* Accuracy: The reliability, truthfulness, and correctness of the information
		* Look at how often it's been cited, etc
	* Purpose: Why does this information exist?
