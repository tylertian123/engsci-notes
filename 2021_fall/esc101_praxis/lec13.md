## Types of Design

1. Conceptual Design: Rough initial ideas
	* e.g. What type of bridge do we want? Suspension, truss, etc
2. Embodiment Design: Specify details, prototypes
	* Hit the reference designs, guidelines, handbooks, etc
3. Detailed Design: Specific details
	* e.g. What specific fastener should we use?
	* Figure out every single little component, and step right into production
4. (Sometimes) Production (Re)design
	* "Make it work in *our context* with our materials, peoples, etc"

## Possible Ways to Frame

* There are many ways to frame the same problem:
	1. Design for the behaviour
	2. Design out of the behaviour
	3. Change the interaction between user and object
	4. Question the concept of the object
* Reference designs help you decide which way of framing is more opportunistic

## Design Briefs

* The design brief answers:
	* Am I able to resolve it? (at what design level)
	* What is the need for it? Is it worth my time?
	* Has it already been solved? (reference designs)
	* What does success look like? (requirements)
	* How can I approach it? (which framing is in scope)
* What is the opportunity? (Purpose)
	* What is the observed behaviour? (Background)
	* Why is it interesting or worth pursuing? (Justification)
	* What do we have to go on? (Background)
	* What has been done before? (Reference Designs)
	* Who cares? (Stakeholders)
