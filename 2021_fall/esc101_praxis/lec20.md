## SCAMPER

* SCAMPER works best from a Morph Chart, or at least a deconstructed reference design; instead of aspects think of actions that a design needs to do
* SCAMPER is for building on existing designs
* SCAM:
	* Substitute: Are there approaches that should be substituted for others in this design? What if we changed <thing>?
		* Acknowledge that an existing approach can do two things
	* Combine: Are there actions/aspects that should be combined into one approach?
		* Collapses multiple rows of the morph chart into one
	* Adapt: Are there approaches that could be adapted to address other aspects/actions?
		* Same but opposite direction as combine
		* Change one approach to make it work for two actions
	* Modify/Magnify/Minimize: If you select a specific approach and emphasize it (change the focus), what effect will it have on the other aspects/actions?
* PER:
	* Put to other uses: What else can these approaches do that's unrelated to what we're trying to do? How might that change what is created?
	* Eliminate: What if an action/aspect wasn't necessary? What if a constraint wasn't present?
		* If the problem is overconstrained, this can be helpful in opening it up
		* Can also be used to shave redundant features
		* Removes a row of the morph chart entirely
	* Reverse/Rearrange: What if aspects/actions were completed in a different order?
