## What is Culture?

* An ensemble of structures, practices, and convention which individuals reproduce or transform but would not exist unless they did so (Bhashar, 1998: p. 36)
* Humility: To have an accurate opinion of yourself, to keep your accomplishments and abilities in perspective; to be free from arrogance **and** low self-esteem
* Culture Humility: the process of accepting that we do not know what it's like to be someone else and live as them, but at the same time be willing to engage in conversations that allow us to learn
* Engage with stakeholders and understand the way they see the problem

## Test Prep: Kolb's Experimental Learning Cycle

* The cycle consists of 4 stages and can start at any stage
	1. Experiencing: Concrete experience
		* Learn from doing
	2. Watching: Reflection and observation
		* Step back and reflect on what you did
		* Compare and contrast different ways of doing a thing
	3. Thinking: Abstraction and Generalization
		* From observations create models and generalize
	4. Trying: Hypothesizing and Testing
		* Experimentation and trying something new
* Different people have different preferences:
	1. Diverger: Experiencing to watching
	2. Assimilator: Watching to thinking
	3. Converger: Thinking to trying
	4. Accomodator: Trying to experiencing
