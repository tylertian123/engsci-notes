* Two foundational models: modelling Engineering Design and Argument

## Models

1. No model is perfect; they're all simplifications that are intended to be **useful**
	* Models are interpretations and simplifications of a broader system and are inherently limited
2. Models are **lenses**; they allow you to see the same situation differently
3. **Some** models are predictive, others are explanatory
	* Not all models are predictive

## Model of Engineering

* At its core, engineering happens in reality: 1. The world as it is, 2. The world as I/we create it
	* This is the "trial-and-error" space: e.g. if you want to test a building, you would build it and load it until it breaks
	* Early research and impractical in today's world
	* "Technology"
* In the "theory" space: 1. The world as I/we perceive it, 2. The world as I/we dream it
	* Using science and math, we model the world as it is to form the world as we perceive it
	* When we build the world as we dream it, we turn it into the world we create
	* "Science and math"
* The goal of this course is to iterate between perception and dream, so when we finally build it, we have a tried-and-true solution
* The process starts with the world as it is, models it, produces the design, and the build it
	* There is a back and forth between the model and the design that Praxis focuses on

## Arguments

* At our core, engineers **make decisions** and **recommend designs**; to push our designs and decisions, we need arguments
* Toulmin's Structure of Argument
	* Any argument starts with a ground: the reason why we make the argument
	* From the ground, a claim is made; in an ideal world, this directly leads to acceptance
	* Any nontrivial claim requires support: bring in justification and evidence to support the claim, qualifiers to limit the claim
	* Example:
		* Ground: technology exists
		* Claim: technology is not applied science
		* Justification: sometimes technology precedes the science that explains it, so science is not necessary prior to technology (claim could be **challenged and questioned**)
		* Evidence: the Wright brothers were flying before aerodynamics; stream engines came before thermodynamics (argument based on historical example; can be **fact-checked**)
		* Qualifier: the "sometimes"; even though our faculty is "Applied Science and Engineering"
	* The order is not set; e.g. an argument can start with a justification, evidence, etc; but the pieces must exist
	* Next lecture: counterclaims
		* Argument by example is vulnerable to counterexamples
* Spectrum of claims: Ground \textrightarrow Analytical Claim \textrightarrow Interpretive Claim \textrightarrow Speculative Claim \textrightarrow Crazy Idea
	* The further a claim is from the ground, the more evidence and justification it requires to be acceptable
	* Analytical \textrightarrow "what?", interpretive \textrightarrow "so what?", speculative \textrightarrow "what could be?"
* Ways to support claims:
	1. Research for facts, for previous designs, codes, standards and guidelines, for approaches and processes, for cognate (similar) concepts and theories
	2. Testing, calculating, modelling
	3. Sketching, low-fidelity prototyping, proofs of concept
