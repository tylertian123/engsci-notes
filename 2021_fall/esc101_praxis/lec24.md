## Feedback Stages

1. Framing feedback -- start to understand the purpose
	* AID model to structure feedback:
		1. Action: What did they do? Not your judgement or thoughts, but specific examples of the behaviour.
		2. Impact: How did this impact the team or yourself?
		3. Development/Desired outcome: What do you want them to do to improve their actions?
2. Delivering feedback for review
3. Receiving feedback
4. Acting on feedback to improve performance

## Giving Useful Negative Feedback

* Critique, unlike criticism, needs to be reasoned, systematic, and consist of argument and discussion
* Focus on growth
