## Comparison Matrices/Pugh Charts

* Pairwise comparisons across all different metrics, relative to a single reference alternative/benchmark
	* Change reference if it doesn't tell you much, e.g. if for a particular critical metric, one alternative is worse than all others, then using that alternative is a bad benchmark
* Columns are alternatives and rows are metrics
* Each entry is whether the alternative is better than the benchmark or worse for that specific metric
* At the end of it, argue for the recommended alternative in words; the matrix does not tell you what the best alternative is
	* Think about "what do I do next"?
		* Change reference design
		* Reconsider whether metrics are useful
		* Re-divergence
		* Analyze patterns for linked metrics
		* Look at metrics that are weighted more and figure out if they can be broken down
		* Look at metrics that are weighted less and figure out why they're there
* Don't sum up the table
* Decision making tools are representations of your candidates that enable comparison
