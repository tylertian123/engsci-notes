## Work Done on Springs

* The reaction force of a spring is $k(x - x_0)$ by Hooke's law and if we set the relaxed length to 0, we get $F = -kx$; since this force is equal and opposite to the applied force, the applied force is $kx$
* The work done by the hand compressing the spring is $\int _0^{x_b} kx\,\dx = \frac{1}{2}kx_b^2$
* The potential energy of the spring is a quadratic function
* Springs are an example of *stable* equilibrium; at $x = x_0$, the spring will actively resist any force that pushes it away from equilibrium
	* *Unstable equilibrium* is like a ball on a hill; if it is pushed even slightly, it will tend towards some other state instead of returning to the same state

## Power

* Power is the rate at which energy changes, $\diff{E}{t}$ or $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$ if the rate is constant; alternatively $P = Fv$
* Power is measured in $\si{J/s} = \si{W}$

## Two-Dimensional Motion

* In two dimensions quantities are represented as two-dimensional vectors $\cvec{x}{y}$
* The vectors can be in any coordinate system, e.g. the axes can be rotated or stretched
