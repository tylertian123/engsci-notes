## Calculating Work

* For a single particle not subject to potential energy change, $\Delta E = W$ and $\Delta E = \Delta K \implies W = \Delta E$
* $v_f = v_i + a\Delta t$ and $\Delta x = v_i\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a\Delta t^2$, so $\alignedeqntwo[t]{W}{\Delta K}{K_f - K_i}{\frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2 - v_i^2)}{\frac{1}{2}m((v_i + a\Delta t)^2 - v_i^2)}{\frac{1}{2}m(2v_ia\Delta t + a^2\Delta t^2)}{ma(v_i\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a\Delta t^2)}{ma\Delta x}{F\Delta x}$
* So work is equal to the product of the force and the displacement of the point the force acts on
* For more than one force $W = \Delta x\sum F_x$
* A closed system has $W = 0$
* There is a parallel between work and impulse; work is to energy as impulse is to momentum
* Problems can be solved in two ways: by considering everything in the system and making it a closed system (chapter 5, energy conservation based approach), or only include some parts and make some forces external (work based approach)

## Multiparticle Systems

* For a multiparticle system some work goes into internal energy, so while $\Delta K$ is the applied force times to the displacement of the centre of mass, this is not quite $W$
* However, all work ends up somewhere, so $W_{env} = -W_{sys}$ and we can use the work done by the environment to find the work done on the system
* If there are multiple forces, the force displacement of each point might not all be equal, so $W = \sum F_i\Delta x_i$

## Changing Forces

* If the force is varying then an integral can be used
