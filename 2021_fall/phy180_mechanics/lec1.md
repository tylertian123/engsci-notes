## Classical Mechanics: Overview

* The study of objects in motion and the influence of forces on them
* Course involves review using calc and more advanced topics, symmetries of situations
	* Learn the difference between hypotheses, assumptions, and derived relations
* Physics is about testing falsifiable hypotheses: learn by disproving hypotheses; uncertainties are very important

## Course Resources

* Quercus homepage (course materials incl. visuals, problem sets, grades)
	* Primary source: [Link](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~william/courses/phy180)
