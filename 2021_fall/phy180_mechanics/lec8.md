## Energy

* Energy comes in many forms: electromagnetic waves, rotational/translational kinetic, thermal, biochemical, etc
* We will study mechanical energy: translational and rotational kinetic energy

## Classifying Collisions

* Elastic collisions: $\Delta v_{12}\text{ initial} = \Delta v_{12}\text{ final} \equiv \abs{v_2 - v_1}$
	* The difference in velocity remains the same before and after the collision, even if the two masses are different
* Totally inelastic collisions: $\Delta v_{12}\text{ final} = 0$, i.e. the two objects stick together

## Kinetic Energy

* $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and does not depend on the direction of motion
* Kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collisions but **not** in inelastic collisions, whereas momentum is conserved in both
* Inelastic collisions usually result in some sort of irreversible change, e.g. irreversible deformations
	* The energy lost goes into the internal energy $E_{int}$: $E = K + E_{int}$
* A closed system has its energy conserved, an open system does not
	* Closed/open for energy, isolated/not isolated for momentum
	* Remember momentum is a vector, so even if the speed does not change, if the direction of motion changes, momentum changes; therefore orbiting planets are not isolated (they change direction and thus momentum)
