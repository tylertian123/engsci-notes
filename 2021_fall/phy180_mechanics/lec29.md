## Simple Harmonic Motion

* Simplest example of an oscillator is a mass on a spring
* The restoring force is $-kx$ so $F = ma = m\diffn{2}{x}{t} = -kx \implies \diffn{2}{x}{t} + \frac{k}{m}x = 0$
	* The solution to this DE is a sinusoid $A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$
	* Substituting this back in we get $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$
* Simple harmonic motion is like looking at uniform circular motion in one axis
* When the system oscillates, there is a constant conversion between kinetic and potential energy
	* At the extremes all the energy is contained in the spring as potential energy
	* When the system passes through equilibrium all the energy is kinetic
	* In-between there's a mix of the two
* Simple harmonic oscillators have the same period regardless of amplitude; no matter how far you pull the spring when you start it, it will still take the same time to complete a full cycle ($\omega$ does not depend on $A$)
* $\threepiece{x(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)}{v(t) = -A\omega\sin(\omega t + \phi)}{a(t) = -A\omega^2\cos(\omega t + \phi}$
	* Maximum displacement is $A$
	* Maximum velocity is $A\omega$
	* Maximum acceleration is $A\omega^2$
