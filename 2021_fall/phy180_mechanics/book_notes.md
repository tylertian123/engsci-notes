## Chapter 1

* Scientific method: Observations induce (generalize to) a hypothesis, which is used to deduce a prediction for a specific case, and that case is tested again for more observations and revise the hypothesis
* Hypothesis: A claim based on observations and assumptions that generalizes a phenomenon; has to be verifiable/falsifiable
	* Beware of hidden assumptions
* Symmetry: To be unchanged under certain operations (invariance); e.g. time and space
* Order of magnitude: Exponent term in scientific notation; if coefficient > 3, round up an order, otherwise round down (since $\log _{10} 3 \approx 0.5$)
* *Book counts trailing digits in numbers w/o decimal point to be significant*, e.g. $3400$ has 4 sig figs
