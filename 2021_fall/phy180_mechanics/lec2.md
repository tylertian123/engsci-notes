* Scientific method: Observations induce hypothesis, hypothesis deduce prediction, prediction tests observations
	* Induction makes generalizations, deductions applies the hypothesis to specific cases
	* Hypothesis is a combination of a model and assumptions
* Physical laws arise from symmetries:
	1. Time invariance: Is physics different "now" compared to "then"?
		* Energy conservation $\iff$ time invariance
	2. Spatial invariance: Is physics different "here" compared to "there"?
		* Momentum conservation $\iff$ spatial invariance
	3. Rotational invariance: Is physics different from "this perspective" compared to a rotated perspective?
		* Angular momentum conservation $\iff$ rotational invariance
* Noether's theorem: Each symmetry corresponds to a conservation law
* Quantities such as $m$ are typically in italics, and units such as $\textrm{m}$ are typically in roman
