## Momentum Continued

* Momentum is a vector: $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$ with units of $\si{kg \cdot m/s}$
* The momentum of a system is the sum of all the momentum of its pieces, and this quantity is conserved
* Momentum is only conserved inside an isolated system, i.e. all the pieces in the interaction are included
	* e.g. momentum is conserved in a collision if both carts are in the system, but it is not if only one cart is in the system, since the other cart would be an external
* The change in momentum is impulse: $\Delta \vec{p} = \vec{J}$ (this quantity is only nonzero when external forces act on the system)
* This even works when the speed of particles is near $c$, such as in Compton scattering
* To choose the right system, identify the interactions, then eliminate objects if interactions cause no acceleration
	* e.g. for two carts sliding without friction, the surface is eliminated, since the interaction with the surface does not create a force/acceleration
* When the two objects stick together, the momentum is still conserved
* If the two carts stick together, they will both move together at the same slower velocity
* $\Delta p_1 + \Delta p_2 = 0 \implies m_1\Delta v_1 + m_2\Delta v_2 = 0 \implies \frac{\Delta v_2}{\Delta v_1} = -\frac{m_1}{m_2} \implies \Delta v_2 = -\frac{m_1\Delta v_1}{m_2}$
