## Momentum and Force

* Force is the rate of change of momentum: $\vec{F} = \diff{d}{t}m\vec{v}$
* For constant masses this is equal to $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$
* The acceleration of an object is caused by the net force, i.e. vector sum of all forces on that object
* Since momentum is conserved, $\Delta p_1 = -\Delta p_2 \implies \frac{\Delta p_1}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta p_2}{\Delta t} \implies F_1 = -F_2$
* Because of this, forces always come in pairs that are opposite in direction but equal in magnitude

## Translational Equilibrium

* An object is in equilibrium if it is not accelerating (this is true for all inertial reference frames since acceleration is the same regardless of reference frame)
* Therefore the object is not subject to any net force
* The object will remain at rest of move at constant velocity
