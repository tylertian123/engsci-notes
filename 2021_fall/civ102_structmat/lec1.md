## Structural Engineering

* Designing structures with economy and elegance to safely resist forces it may be subject to
* Art and science components
* Engineering comes from Latin *inginure* -- to create and English *ingenium* -- clever

## The 3 Principles of Engineering

1. $F = ma$ -- we use math equations to model systems
2. You can't push a rope -- we can't always rely on just equations; we need common sense too
3. To find the answer, you must know the answer -- experience is very important; if you're doing something for the first time, be extremely careful

## Significant Digits

* Use 3 significant digits iff first nonzero digit $\neq 1$
* Use 4 significant digits if first nonzero digit is $1$
* Using these numbers give us about $0.5\%$ accuracy; because the Earth is not a sphere, $g$ varies between different locations by about this amount, so there's no point to be more precise (for this course use $9.81$)
* Use engineering notation (exponents for scientific notation should be multiples of 3) -- easier to think about so we know whether numbers are realistic
