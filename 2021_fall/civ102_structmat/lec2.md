*De omnibus dubitandum*: Question everything; keep an open mind

## Forces

* A push or a pull that can cause an object to move or deform; by its nature a vector quantity
* Forces are measured in newtons; $1\si{N}$ is about the weight of a small apple; $1\si{kN}$ is about the weight of a football player
	* In imperial units pounds are used
* When objects are not accelerating, $\sum \vec{F} = 0$ (translational equilibrium)
* Forces can be broken down into axis-aligned components

## Moments

* Knowing translational forces sometimes isn't enough
* All torques are moments, but not all moments are torques
	* In structural engineering torques are moments where the rotational axis is the long axis of the object
* Rotations need a reference point $i$, the point about which the rotation happens
* $\vec{d}$ is the lever arm, the distance over which the force is acting
* The moment is $\vec{M} = \vec{F} \times \vec{d}$; this has units of $\si{Nm}$; although this is the same unit as energy they're different, since moment is the cross product and energy is the dot product
* Moments try to rotate an object while translational forces try to move it; the moment is a measure of how much the object wants to rotate
* The same force can cause rotations in different directions depending on the reference point
* Special case: When a pair of forces are going in equal and opposite directions and separated by some distance $d$, this is called a *couple*
	* Since the forces cancel each other out, there is no translational motion, only rotation
	* Also called a *pure moment*

## Unit Conversions

* When converting units, we multiply the quantity by unit conversion fractions equal to 1
