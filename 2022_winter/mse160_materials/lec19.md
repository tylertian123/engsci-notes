## Elastic Behaviour

* $F = -\diff{U}{r}$ where $U(r)$ is the potential between atoms with respect to interatomic distance
* $\eval{\diff{U}{r}}{r = r_0} \propto E$
* Young's modulus $E$ is *independent of structure* in the linear region, i.e. it only depends on the atoms of the solid
	* Note this is only applicable to metals
	* e.g. $E$ for carbon steel ranges from $190$ to $210\si{GPa}$; all steels have about the same stiffness, but some steels are stronger than others
* When a material is stretched beyond its elastic range, it will recover elastically with the same Young's modulus but won't return to the original length
