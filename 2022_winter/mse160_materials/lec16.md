## Determining Phase Composition

* Given $T$ and $C_0$ we can determine the composition of the phases present
* When there are multiple phases present, draw a horizontal tie line (isotherm), and the compositions are the compositions at the liquidus and solidus
* The tie line can be thought of as a lever: $M_{\alpha}S = M_LR$
* Compare the relative lengths of the isoterms

## Cored and Equilibrium Structures

* In a equilibrium phase diagram we give infinite time to allow the material to reach equilibrium
* In practice there is often not enough time for equilibrium to form when cooling is fast
* With enough time diffusion smoothes out the grains; if cooling is too fast (quenching) the structure will be *cored*: the innermost layers have higher concentration and then lower concentrations in the outer layers

## Mechanical Properties

* Combining metals in solid solution strengthens the materials
	* e.g. in nickel-copper alloy this increases tensile strength but decreases ductility

## Binary Eutectic Systems

* "Low melting point" materials with limited solubility with each other
* 2 solid phases, each with limited solubility
	* The lines bounding the left and right regions are the solubility limits
* At the eutectic concentration:
	* Above the melting point we get a homogeneous liquid
	* Just below the eutectic line we get both phases
* For an alloy of composition $C_0 = C_E$, a lamella structure is formed
	* $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases alternate in micropatterns
	* Rapid diffusion over very small distances as the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases form
* Going from above the eutectic temperature to below the eutectic temperature locks in the grains formed initially and the rest of the liquid forms lamellae
* Hypoeutectic: lower than the eutectic concentration; hypereutectic: above the eutectic concentration
