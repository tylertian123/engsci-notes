## Tacticity

* Polyethylene crystallizes readily, giving it higher density
* *Isotactic*: The functional group in the mer unit is always on the same side
* *Syndiotactic*: The functional groups alternate on both sides
* *Atatic*: Random placement of the functional groups
* In general isotactic is the easiest to crystallize, followed by syndiotactic and then atactic 
* e.g. atactic polypropylene is amorphous (linear low density PP, clear and flexible, used in soda bottles), vs isotactic PP which is more crystalline, stronger and more rigid, used in detergent bottles

## Side Chains

* PE chains are never perfect single chains; they always have side chains coming out
* HDPE has shorter side chains, making it easier for chains to line up and crystallize; LDPE has longer side chains, making it harder to crystallize, more flexible and less strong
	* The actual densities are not very different, but the crystallinity creates large differences in material properties

## Changing Mer Units (Composition)

* Different mer units have different intermolecular bonding
* Example: PVC (changing one of the hydrogens on PE to chlorine)
	* Chlorine is much more electronegative and forms a dipole, creating a polar molecule
	* Since intermolecular forces are dipole-dipole interactions, the stronger polarization creates a stronger intermolecular bond

## Cross Linking

* Creating covalent bonds between polymer chains (primary bonding between chains)
* Since primary bonds are much stronger than secondary bonds this makes the polymer stronger
* Cross linking also prevents plastic flow, i.e. plastic deformation
* Example: Vulcanization of rubber
	* Sulfur compounds build cross links between raw rubber chains
	* Raw rubber from the tree is a fluid, but after vulcanization the new bonds hold the rubber together
* Elastomer: A polymer with large elasticity (i.e. it can be stretched a lot without plastic deformation)
	* Elastomers can be created with cross linking, since the primary bonds pull the chains back to their original position
	* However too much cross linking makes the polymer brittle
* Hysteresis: The return curve upon unloading is not the same as the original loading curve
	* When some materials are loaded and then unloaded, the return path on unloading is different, even though there is full elastic recovery
	* Since the area under the stress-strain curve represents energy, loading and then unloading takes energy (converts to heat)
	* This can be used for shock absorption as the elastomer absorbs energy

## Temperature Dependence

* Intermolecular bonds have much lower energy than covalent or ionic bonds
* Energy in intermolecular bonds is comparable to thermal energy, meaning relatively small variations in temperature near room temperature can have large impacts on a polymer
* At colder temperatures polymers are brittle and behave almost like ceramics; at warmer temperatures they are much more flexible and can be deformed a lot
