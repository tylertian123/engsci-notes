## Intermetallic Compounds

* Intermetallic compounds have no solid solubility
* They exist as lines on a phase diagram, not an area due to stoichiometry (composition of the compound is fixed)
	* Lines can have thickness due to departures from the stoichiometry from e.g. vacancies

## Invariant Reactions

* Eutectic: Liquid transforms into two slid phases
	* -ic suffix involves a liquid
	* $L \rightleftharpoons \alpha + \beta$
* Eutectoid: One solid phase transforms to two other solid phases
	* -oid suffix means solid phases
	* $S_1 \rightleftharpoons S_2 + S_3$
* Peritectic: A solid and a liquid transform into a second solid
	* $\gamma + L \rightleftharpoons \varepsilon$
