## Molecular Weight in Polymers

* The main part of strengthening polymers involves making it harder for polymer chains to slide past each other
* Molecular weight: the size of each macromolecule
	* The longer the molecules (higher molecular weight), the more they will get tangled and so the polymer will become stronger
		* e.g. UHMWPE
* Not all molecules are the same weight, so several methods are used to describe the distribution:
	* Number average: $\bar M_n = \sum _i x_iM_i$
		* Broken into "bins" of mass/length ranges
		* $x_i$ is the *number fraction*, the fraction of molecules that are in that bin
		* $M_i$ is the mass of each molecule in that bin
		* Exactly like a normal weighted average
	* Weight average: $\bar M_w = \sum _i w_iM_i$
		* $w_i$ is the *weight fraction*, $w_i = \frac{N_iM_i}{\sum _j N_jM_j}$
			* i.e. $w_i$ is the total weight molecules in that bin divided by the total weight of all molecules
		* Bins with higher molecular weight are weighted more in the average
	* The weight average is always greater than the number average (except the hypothetical case where all chains are the same length)
	* $\DJ = \frac{\bar M_w}{\bar M_n}$ ("D stroke") is the *dispersivity* or *polydispersivity index* and measures spread (width of distribution)
		* This number is greater than 1; the greater the dispersivity, the more wide the spread of molecular weights
		* $\DJ$ for isotatic commodity grade (i.e. cheap) polypropylene is about 3.5 (i.e. a very wide distribution)

## Crystallinity of Polymers

* Sometimes polymers can fold into regular patterns and crystallize
	* It's impossible for the entire polymer to crystallize
	* There are crystallized regions with amorphous regions in between
* More crystallization implies higher density
* Since the chains are folded tightly, the intermolecular bonds are stronger so the polymer has higher strength, wear resistance, and higher resistance to chemicals
