## Strengthening Metals

* Plastic deformation occurs by the movement of linear dislocations
* The presence of other imperfections, e.g. vacancies, interstitial atoms, etc can affect the dislocation movement
* A linear dislocation itself puts the atoms under tension, which can be slowed down by other imperfections as they also put compression or tension on the atoms
	* This is why alloying can make the metal stronger by affecting dislocation movement
* Annealing: Heating up a metal
	* This relieves residual stress introduced by processing and also promotes grain growth (reduces density grain boundaries)
	* Annealing makes the metal more ductile
* Plastically deforming the metal intrudes more defects, making it harder for dislocations to move and strengthening the metal
	* Repeatedly deforming introduces more and more defects, making it more brittle and eventually breaking
* Grain size has a huge effect on metal strength
	* When grain size is very small (nanocrystalline), the metal is effectively amorphous
	* Smaller grain size and amorphous metals make it much harder for dislocations to move and so makes the metal stronger
	* However it's very difficult to make amorphous metals
* Second phases are 3D defects
	* e.g. aluminum alloy precipitation hardening
* Summary: Strengthening mechanisms in alloys:
	* Work hardening: Plastically deforming the material to induce more dislocations (e.g. bending a bar to make it stronger)
	* Solid solution hardening: Introducing interstitial defects through a solid solution (e.g. putting carbon in iron to make steel)
	* Precipitation hardening: Forcing particles of a second phase to precipitate out (3D defect)
	* Grain refinement: Influencing the grain structure in various different ways (e.g. rolling, forging)
