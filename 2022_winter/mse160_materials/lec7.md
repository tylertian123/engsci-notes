## Electron Configurations

* Recall the restrictions on the atomic quantum numbers: $n > 0, 0 \leq l \leq n - 1, \abs{m_t} \leq l$
	* $n$ designated $K, L, M, N, \cdots$, determines the "shell", i.e. average distance from the nucleus; within the principal energy state there are energy sub-states
	* $l$ designated $s, p, d, f$, orbitals within the shell (angle from the $z$ axis)
	* $m_l$, designated $1, 3, 5, 7, \cdots$ (number of states), (motion around the $z$ axis)
	* $m_s$, $\pm \frac{1}{2}$, spin up or down
* As we go out we have more capacity for electrons ($n = 1$ has 2 spots, $n = 2$ has 8 spots, $n = 3$ has 18, etc), which matches the periodic table
* Each energy sub-level relates to a different orbital shape
	* $s$ orbitals ($l = 0$) are all spherical, regardless of $n$
	* $p$ orbitals are dumbbell shaped and oriented along the 3 spacial axes ($p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$)
	* $d$ orbitals have 5 orbitals, 4 with the same clover shape in different planes, and the 5th has its own shape
* Electrons have discrete energy states and tend to occupy the lowest energy state available
	* Energy increases as $n$ increases
	* Within the principal quantum numbers the higher numbers of $l$ have more energy
	* However the $3d$ shell has a higher energy than the $4s$ shell
* When a shell is completely filled (with its sub-shells) it is stable; most elements don't have a stable outer shell, the stable ones are the noble gases with the outer shells completely filled
* Electron configurations in the form e.g. $1s^2$ where the 1 indicates principal quantum number, $s$ indicates shell ($l$) and the 2 is the number of electrons in that shell (spin up + spin down)
