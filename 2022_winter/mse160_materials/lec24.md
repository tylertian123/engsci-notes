## Structure of Polymers

* Toughness: How much energy a material can absorb before it breaks
	* The area under a stress strain curve has a unit of $\si{N/m^2}$ or $\si{N.m/m^3}$, or energy per volume
* Polymers are long chains of molecules
* Simplest polymer: polyethylene (PE)
	* Note polymers are named from the starting molecule
* The long molecule chains get tangled in a polymer and are loosely connected together; both intramolecular forces and intermolecular forces are at play
	* A polymer's strength is dependent on how easily the molecule chains slide past each other
* For a polymer, the yield strength is defined as the first peak of the curve; the tensile strength is the stress at which it breaks
* Some common polymers:
	* Polyethylene (PE): 2 carbons, every carbon has only 2 hydrogen
		* Has many varieties, e.g. high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, Dyneema)
	* Polypropylene (PP): 2 carbons, one carbon has 2 hydrogens, the other has 1 hydrogen and a methyl ($\ce{CH3}$) group
		* Used in plastic bags
	* Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): 2 carbons, one with 2 hydrogens, one with 1 hydrogen and 1 chlorine
		* Used in pipes
		* Typically stiff, but plasticizers can be added to make it flexible
	* Polytetrafluoroethlene (PTFE): Like PE but with fluorine instead of hydrogen
		* Also known as Teflon
		* Carbon-fluorine bond is strong so this material is very inert
	* Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA): 2 carbons, one with 2 hydrogens, the other with a methyl group and (carbon with double bonded oxygen, and single bonded oxygen with methyl group)
		* Also known as acrylic
		* Glasses are made of this
		* The big side chain prevents the chains from stacking next to each other
* Putting a polymer under tension lines up the molecules in a single direction
	* This increases the tensile strength since more of the load is now carried by stronger intramolecular bonds rather than intermolecular bonds
	* Pulling it in the other direction afterwards is much easier to do, since the chains are now aligned in the wrong direction
	* Also changes optical properties (e.g. makes the plastic white)
