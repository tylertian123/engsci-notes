## Wave-Particle Duality and The Bohr Model 

* Classically particles and waves are distinct, but in the 20th century we found matter can behave like waves and waves can behave like particles
	* The photoelectric effect shows that light (which was known to be electromagnetic waves) behaving like particles through the photoelectric effect, described by Planck and Einstein
	* Exciting hydrogen atoms and other gases only emits specific discrete spectral lines
	* Shooting electrons through a diffraction grating ($\ce{Ni}$ crystals) show diffraction behaviour which is wavelike
* De Broglie relation: $p = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \hbar k$ proposes that particles can exhibit wavelike behaviour, relating classical momentum, which is a property of particles, to a wavelength (from $E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4$ and $E = h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$)
* Rutherford-Bohr model: negatively charged electron orbiting a positively charged electron
	* If we equate the centripetal force on the electron $\frac{mv^2}{r}$ to the Coulomb force $\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon _0r^2}$ we get $v^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon _0mr}$
	* Adding energy, i.e. adding velocity, will decrease the radius; however we get a continuous relation between $r$ and $v$ while in reality this is not true
	* Bohr added interference through $n\lambda = I_{orbit} = 2\pi r$ with $n$ as a quantisation constant, because the radius has to be an integer multiple of the wavelength for the waves to constructively interfere
	* Invoking de Broglie's relation $mv = \frac{\hbar}{\lambda}$ and equating $\lambda$ we get $v = \frac{hn}{2\pi mr}$ and angular velocity $L = mvr = n\hbar$, i.e. angular momentum is quantized in units of $\hbar$
	* Equating the expressions for $v$ and solving for $r$, the allowed radii are $r_n = \frac{\hbar^2\varepsilon _0n^2}{\pi me^2} = a_{Bohr}n^2$ where $n$ is a positive integer, and the *Bohr radius* is the smallest radius, about $\SI{5.3e-11}{m}$
	* Solving for the total energy (sum of kinetic and Coulomb energy) gives energy inversely proportional to $n^2$ (and negative because the larger the $n$ the less energy it has)
	* Using this we can write an expression for the energy emitted as the electron jumps between states, and we get the Rydberg equation back!
* Even though the Bohr model explains the hydrogen spectrum, it fails:
	* Assumes circular electron orbits, which is fundamentally incorrect, so it only works for hydrogen and fails miserably for helium
	* It treats electrons as things with definite radius and momentum, which is in violation of the uncertainty principle
	* Does explain where the emission lines are, but not why some are brighter than the others
