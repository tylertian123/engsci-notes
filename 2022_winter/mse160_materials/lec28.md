## Optical Properties of Polymers

* Crystalline and amorphous regions in polymers have different optical properties
* In a crystalline polymer the mix of amorphous and crystalline regions scatter light, making the polymer translucent or opaque
* Polymers that don't crystallize (e.g. PMMA) are 100% amorphous, no light scattering results in transparency

## Optical Properties

* The visible light range is approximately $\lambda = 400\si{nm}$ to $\lambda = 700\si{nm}$
* The photon energy is $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = 1.77\si{eV}$ for $700\si{nm}$, and $3.1\si{eV}$ for $400\si{nm}$

## Bonding

* Ionic bonding (ionic solids): exchange of electrons
	* Example: $\ce{NaCl}$ with the rock salt structure
		* Using $E = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon _0r}$ we can calculate the energy by calculating the sum of an infinite series
		* 6 attractive neighbours at a distance of $a$ away; 12 repulsive neighbours at a distance of $\sqrt{2}a$ away, etc
		* This series converges to $M\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon _0}\frac{1}{a}$ where $M$ is the Madeluing constant
* Covalent bonding: sharing of electrons
	* When two atoms are brought together for covalent bonding, their electron wavefunctions overlap
	* In the anti symmetric combination, this is the *anti-bonding state*
		* There's a node exactly in the middle of the two wavefunctions
		* The node results in the two electron clouds being separated
	* In the symmetric configuration, it is called the *bonding state*
		* There is now a nonzero probability for electrons to be between the two atoms to facilitate bonding
	* The bonding state is at a lower energy than the two individual atoms, and the antibonding state is higher
	* Electrons go into this bonding state since it has lower energy, and this makes a bond
* Metallic bonding: cloud of free electrons holding together nuclei
