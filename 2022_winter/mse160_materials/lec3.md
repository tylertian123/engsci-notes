## Quantum Waves

* Classical travelling waves $\Psi = Ae^{i(kx - \omega t)})$ with amplitude $A$, wavelength $\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}$, $\omega = 2\pi\nu$; velocity of the wave is $c = \frac{\omega}{k}$
* Such a wave conveys no position information since it has constant amplitude and wavelength everywhere
* The Born interpretation: the square of the wavefunction at any point is proportional to the probability of finding the particle in space at that point (i.e. $\Psi^2$ is the probability density)
* This interpretation leads to some restrictions on $\Psi$:
	* It must be continuous
	* It must not be multi-valued
	* It must be normalizable (implies finite, can't be zero or constant)
* Time evolution of wavefunctions is governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation: $\hat{E}\Psi = i\hbar\pdiff{}{t}\Psi$
* Wave packets are fuzzy in both temporal and spacial extent
