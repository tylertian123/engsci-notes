## Density of Crystalline Structures

* We can estimate theoretical density from the type of crystalline structure
* $\rho = \frac{nA}{V_cN_A}$ where $n$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $A$ is the atomic weight, $V_c$ is the unit cell volume, and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number (atoms per mole)
* Example: Chromium
	* Structure is BCC so $\rho = 7.18\si{g/cm^3}$ theoretically
	* Actual density is $7.19\si{g/cm^3}$
* In general metals are denser than ceramics which are denser than polymers
	* In metals atoms typically have higher mass and are packed closer together

## Single and Polycrystal Materials

* Single crystal materials are used in some applications such as diamond for abrasives
* A perfect single crystal has the same structure and translational symmetry everywhere
* Most engineering materials however are polycrystals -- made of "grains" of single crystals
* Polycrystals can be isotropic in some parts and anisotropic in other parts
	* Difference in cooling rate, e.g. removing heat along one axis, will cause the material to solidify differently in different directions and create anisotropic grains
* Single crystals are anisotropic (properties vary with direction); e.g. Young's modulus for BCC iron is $125\si{GPa}$ on the edges but $273\si{GPa}$ diagonally
* Polycrystals may or may not be isotropic depending on how the grains are oriented -- if grains are oriented randomly we get an isotropic material, but if the grains are textured (i.e. elongated in a certain direction) we have an anisotropic material
	* We can also introduce texture during processing by pulling on the material to give the grains a preferential orientation

## Polymorphism/Allotropy

* The same material can take on several crystalline structures, e.g. carbon can form diamond or graphite, titanium has $\alpha$ and $\beta$
* Iron crystallizes into different structures depending on the temperature

## Crystallographic Directions

* Coordinates are multiples of $a, b, c$ the dimensions of the unit cell
* Crystallographic directions are denoted by $[uvw]$ where these are all smallest integer values and an overbar is used to indicate a negative index
* We don't really know which axis is the $x$, $y$ or $z$ with respect to the real world, so we have families of directions
	* Example: $\langle 100 \rangle$ is a family with 6 elements: $[100], [010], [001]$ and their negative versions; $\langle 111 \rangle$ is a family with 8 elements
* In HCP, we use $[uvtw]$ instead, where $uvt$ are in the same plane and $120\degree$ apart (since unit cells are hexagonal)
	* $uvt$ is in the *basal plane*
