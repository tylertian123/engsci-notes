## Imperfections

* There is no such thing as a perfect crystal -- imperfections always exist
	* Certain types of defects are at equilibrium
	* Vacancies (missing atoms) create imperfections
	* The concentration of such defects affect how the material behaves
* Types of imperfections:
	* Point defects: Vacancies (missing atoms); interstitial/substitutional atoms (atoms that are on the wrong site)
		* Interstitial atoms are extra atoms between atomic sites, distorting planes by pushing the atoms apart
		* Self-interstitial is an interstitial atom that's the same atom as the crystal
		* Vacancies also distort the plane structure as the atomic forces pull the surrounding atoms in
			* This is called a *strain* and has stored elastic energy
	* Line defects: Dislocations
	* Areal defects: Grain boundaries

## Point Defects

* $\frac{N_v}{N} = e^{\frac{-Q_v}{kT}}$
	* $N_v$ is the number of defects and $N$ the number of defect sites
	* $Q_v$ is the activation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature
	* Higher temperature allows atoms to overcome activation energy
	* Each lattice site is a potential vacancy site
* Activation energy can be measured through experiments using the defect concentration
* Vacancies cause "islands" to form on the surface
* When an impurity is added to a host there are 2 outcomes (this happens when the two substances don't naturally bond but are compatible):
	* Solid solution (random distribution fof point defects)
		* Substitutional solid (impurity in places where the host atoms were) or interstitial solid (impurity in between host atoms)
	* Solid solution plus particles of a second phase (usually for a larger amount of impurities when we go past the solubility)
		* The impurity atoms and host atoms form a second phase with often different structure and composition
* Conditions for substitutional solid solution: Hume-Rothery rules
	1. $\Delta r < 15\%$ (atomic radii similar) (empirical)
	2. Proximity in the periodic table (similar electronegativity)
	3. Same crystal structure for pure metals
	4. Valency: Metal will have a greater tendency to dissolve a metal of higher valency than one of lower valency
* Quantifying composition: Weight percent $C_1 = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}$ or atomic percent $C_1 = \frac{n_{m1}}{n_{m1} + n_{m2}}$

## Line Defects

* Dislocations are line defects
* Crystal planes slip when the material is placed under stress, e.g. zinc (HCP) under tensile elongation causes the diagonal planes to slip so the material can elongate (slip steps)
* Dislocations produce permanent (plastic) deformations
* Linear defects: 1D defects around which atoms are misaligned; 2 types:
	* Edge dislocation: Extra half-plane of atoms inserted into the structure
		* *Burgers vector* $b$ perpendicular to the dislocation line
		* The extra plane of atoms squeezed in deforms the crystal and pushes planes apart to make room
	* Screw dislocation: Half-planes shear due to twisting
		* Burgers vector is in the direction of the shear
	* The two types of dislocations can be mixed
* Dislocations can be seen with an electron microscope as scattering changes due to the imperfections
* Edge dislocations can move along the Burgers vector by only breaking one bond at a time
