## Material Properties

* Force must be normalized per unit area: stress $\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$ in pascals $\si{Pa}$
* Deformation must be normalized per unit length: strain $\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$
* To quantify strength and material properties we plot these on a stress-strain curve
* When a material is in its linear region, stress is related to strain by $\sigma = E\epsilon$ where $E$ in pascals is the Young's modulus
