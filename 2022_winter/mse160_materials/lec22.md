## Tempered Glass

* Glass is made of $\ce{SiO2}$ or fused silica
	* A pure single crystal of $\ce{SiO2}$ is called quartz
* Typical glass is soda lime glass (70-74% $\ce{SiO2}$, 13% $\ce{NaO}$ and 10% $\ce{CaO}$), added to lower the melting point and make it easier to work with
* Tempered glass is made by rapidly cooling the outside of glass and leaving the inside to cool slowly
	* The outside is frozen but the inside still contracts from cooling, so the outside zone is under compression since it's being pulled by the centre
	* Glass can also be chemically tempered, where the sodium ions are replaced with bigger ions to create the same compression
	* A Prince Rupert's drop is an extreme example of this

## 3-Point Test

* Since ceramics are brittle and have very low failure strain, it's hard to do a conventional tensile test
* A 3-point test is used instead, where the specimen is supported on 2 sides and a force is applied on the midpoint until the material breaks
* The maximum tensile stress can be found by $\sigma = \frac{3FL}{2wh^2}$

## More About Stress-Strain Curves

* Since it is difficult to quantify where the linear relationship ends, the convention is to use a line at $0.2\%$ strain with the same slope as the Young's Modulus
* Past the yield strength we have uniform plastic deformation, where the entire specimen stretches uniformly
	* Increased dislocation formation as the material strengthens under stress
* The peak of this curve is the ultimate tensile strength
* Past the ultimate tensile strength nonuniform plastic deformation happens as the material begins to neck
	* The strengthening of the necked area is not enough to keep up with the reduction of the cross-sectional area
	* Real stress goes up, but since engineering stress doesn't account for the reduced cross section, the engineering stress actually goes down
