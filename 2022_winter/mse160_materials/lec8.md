## Atomic Bonding

* Atoms try to achieve the most stable (lowest energy) configuration by achieving closed shells
* Two types of bonds: primary (ionic, covalent and metallic) and secondary (dipole interactions); we will focus on the former
	* Primary bonds have a high separation energy
	* Ionic: electron exchange, covalent: electron sharing, metallic: delocalized sharing
		* Delocalized electrons are not bound; they have enough energy that they're not stuck in a potential well
* Most elements have unstable electron configurations; e.g. Lithium $1s^22s^1$, while elements such as Neon $1s^22s^22p^6$ have fully filled outer shells and are stable
	* Recall: $s$ orbital has 2 electrons, $p$ orbital has $6$, $d$ has 10, $f$ has 14, which comes from the constraints on the quantum numbers and spin up/down electrons
	* *Electropositive* elements readily give up electrons to become positive ions; *electronegative* elements readily acquire electrons to become negative ions
* Electronegativity is quantified using the Pauling scale, ranging from 0.7 (francium) to 4.0 (fluorine)
* Ionic bond: local and discrete (an absolute amount of charge is moved), between metal (gives electron to become +) and nonmetal (takes electron to become -)
	* Happens when two elements differ greatly in electronegativity
	* Electrons are transferred from one atom to another, creating a positively charged and negatively charged atom, and a Coulomb attraction force
	* Example: $\ce{NaCl}, \ce{MgO}$
