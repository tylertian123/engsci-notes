## Mesh Analysis With Current Sources

* When there's a current source at the edge of a circuit, we can get the branch current from the source directly
* For dependent current (or voltage sources), express the variable that it depends on in terms of mesh currents, similar to nodal analysis
* When there's a current source shared by two meshes, combine the two meshes into a single "supermesh" like a supernode for nodal analysis and write KVL for this supermesh
	* This takes away one equation, but another equation can be written for the current source
* Mesh analysis can only solve *planar* circuits (all the circuits we see in this course are planar)
