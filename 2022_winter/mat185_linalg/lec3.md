## Vector Spaces, Continued

* Consider: $\Set{(x, y) | x, y in \reals}$ with the operations defined as $(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) \equiv (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2 + 1)$ and $\alpha(x, y) \equiv (\alpha x, \alpha y + \alpha - 1)$
	* Zero is $(0, -1)$
	* Inverse is $(-x, -y - 2)$
	* Actually distributive
	* Since all axioms hold this is actually a vector space
