## Community Finding

* 4 Frameworks:
	1. Design for technology: Address constraints such as budget, time, functionality, established by a client
	2. HCD (Human-Centered Design) for users: Emphasizes users' needs, desires and cultural location mainly through ergonomics and aesthetics
	3. HCD for communities: Considers low-income and underserved communities as users; incorporates listening to users, accommodation of their needs and desires and attention to their situations and their resources, limitations, and opportunities
	4. Design for social justice: Explicitly motivated by the goal of equitable distribution of opportunities and resources
* Capability to approach to humanity/social justice:
	* Capabilities are defined by the community vs 10 central human capabilities that make life livable
	* People have the potential to do and be and capabilities are the "real freedoms" to do that (i.e. they have all the required means necessary to do so)
	* How might design enable being or doing?
	* The 10 central capabilities:
		1. Life
		2. Bodily health
		3. Bodily integrity
		4. Space for emotion
		5. Space for senses, imagination, and thought
		6. Practical reason
		7. Affiliation
		8. Other species
		9. Play
		10. Control over one's environment (politics)
	* We should consider whether our design enable or violate these capabilities
	* Don't ask a community "what can I fix for you" because that violates their control over their environment
* High authority sources are controlled (e.g. journals and handbooks are reviewed)
* Medium authority sources are curated (e.g. conference proceedings and journalistic media)
* Community sources are unknown, could be controlled or uncontrolled
	* These are the sources that we need to "use credibly" -- harder to use than the high authority sources
	* However these are local, specific, and timely and can be more relevant depending on the case
	* Make use of the position of the source, or make clear of their bias
	* Keeping their bias in view distinguishes their opinions from yours
