## Requirements Checklist

1. Is the Core Intention of your opportunity present?
	* The engineering opportunity should still reflect the experienced discomfort in the first place
	* You shouldn't make the thing so complicated that you lose your original intention
2. Have you determined your high-level and detailed objectives?
	* High-level objectives may not be directly measurable or contextualized; they sound like DfXes
		* They may simply be a value that you want to bring into the project
		* Kind of like stakeholder statements
		* Are our values in our high-level objectives?
	* Detailed objectives brings the design values into the context of the opportunity, specifying it with the language of the stakeholders
		* Detailed objectives make your high-level objectives: specific (to the context/your stakeholders), measurable (enable verification), and able to be connected to relevant research such as codes and standards
		* Use DfX literature (e.g. handbooks) to give you benchmarks and metrics
3. Have you checked the alignment of your objectives and metrics?
	* Do you metrics actually measure your objectives?
	* Does the metric actually measure the *core concept* in the detailed metric?
	* If it does not, then you haven't found the right metric, or you need to reframe the way you look at the detailed metric
	* If a proxy metric is used (e.g. hours required for training as a metric for "use without assistance"), you need to explain why
	* Keep in mind that the systems of measurement of the community may be different
4. Does your requirements visualization have everything connected with all the necessary elements?
	* Connect stakeholder interests to objectives, and then connect to metrics, and constraints and criteria
	* Make sure you don't have stakeholders that are not reflected, or objectives without metrics to measure them
	* Visualization includes detailed objectives; high-level objectives are like the stakeholders parts
	* The representation doesn't need to include details for the metrics; but those details need be to included elsewhere
	* Requiring cross-referencing is okay
