## Root Cause Analysis

* Need to go from an experienced discomfort to an actual engineering opportunity characterized by what the actual cause is
* Why is this happening?
	* Why is that happening?
* How can we frame this in engineering design?
	* How do we define engineering design? What DfXes might be relevant?
* Example: Nike Flyease -- getting in and out of shoes without hands is annoying -- maybe we should design a shoe for exactly that behaviour
	* Identify the pieces of the system and their interactions
* What is engineering design to you? How do you show that you've actually done engineering design?
