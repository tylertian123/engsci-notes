## Crafting a Group Introduction

* Purpose
	* Be honest and transparent
	* "We are hoping to get to know a community that might be interested in developing a project with us"
* Attention
	* Give them a reason to care
	* "I worked with a food bank in my home town and was able to reduce waste"
* Sense of good will
	* Create an opening for them or for conversation
	* "We would appreciate an opportunity to speak with you about <thing>"
* For phone calls, structure it, but don't script a conversation
	1. Introduce yourself and your reason for calling
	2. Create space for response -- get into a conversation
	3. Plan points to say
	4. Listen to their responses and build off them
	5. Offer a way to go deeper or a way out
	6. Seek a "good" time for more detailed conversation
* When working with a vulnerable community:
	1. Will they be harmed if you develop a project that does not go forward?
	2. Will their sense of their worth diminish if the project does not go forward?
	3. Do you have or are you able to acquire empathy and competence to interact with them?
