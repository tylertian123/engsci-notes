## Writing the RFP

* What must a team do to take responsibility?
	1. Build requirements
	2. Define the opportunity so the designers can understand it
	3. Explain the community so the designers can engage with them
	4. Show due diligence through reference designs and research to define the opportunity in context
* The abstract answers:
	1. What is the opportunity? (Purpose)
	2. Where does this opportunity fit? (Backgrounds)
	3. What is important to success? (Requirements)
	4. What have we got to go on? (Reference Designs)
* Write the abstract after the rest of the RFP is done!
* The abstract is *not* the introduction -- it's a summary
* The order of these questions can vary, and the abstract's structure can be different from the RFP's
