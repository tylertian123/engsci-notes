1.
	* The Code requires the engineer to act with fairness and loyalty to associates, employers, clients, subordinates and employees (provision 1(i)). Delaying certification for the purpose of saving the owner money would not be a fair act, so the engineer should not do so.
	* Being dishonest about the certification also violates the requirement of "devotion to high ideals of personal honour and professional integrity."
2. Does Code of Ethics permit an engineer to accept shares of client’s company instead of cash for provision of unbiased report as to project? 
	* Accepting shares in the client company could be a potential conflict of interest, since the engineer would be pushed towards reporting more positive results so that the shares rise in value.
	* However as long as the report is unbiased, the Code of Ethics does not explicitly forbid this.
	* Provision 4 states that the engineer must disclose any interest that might influence their judgement, which accepting shares could constitute.
3. 
	* Provision 2(i) states that public welfare should be paramount, so since this is a serious safety risk for employees the engineer needs to act on it.
	* The engineer has a duty to express fairly the consequences of disregarding professional judgement, so the most suitable action is to explain clearly the issue to the client, showing them and putting it in writing.
	* The Code of Ethics does not explicitly require the Ministry of Labour to be informed, but again if the risk to public welfare (employee safety) is high then they have a responsibility to ensure that the employees are safe.
