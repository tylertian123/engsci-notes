## Briefing a Case

* Case briefs are summaries of cases and the facts applied
	* They should be as short as possible and are often half-page summaries
* The most common elements of a brief are:
	* Facts: what actually happened, and any lower court judgements in the case of appeals
	* Issues: the questions that are being disputed
		* Often this can be questions of fact (e.g. what were people doing) and questions of law (e.g. a specific definition or whether a law applies)
	* Rule/Ratio: the main legal principles derived from the case
	* Reasoning: why did the court decide what they did?
	* Holding: the decision of the case
* Example: *R. (Ont.) v. Ron Engineering*, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111
	* Facts:
		* Ron Engineering (contractor) submitted a bid for a contract along with a \$150,000 deposit, to be returned after the contract was executed.
		* In the contract, if the bid is withdrawn or late, the Water Resources Commission can keep the deposit.
		* The amount in the bid was discovered to be off by \$750,058, which Ron Engineering notified the Commission about, but did not withdraw the bid as they argued that the bid could not be accepted.
		* Since the bid was not withdrawn, the owner decided to enter the contract but the contractor declined, so the owner kept the deposit; therefore the contractor sued to recover the deposit.
		* The trial judge originally sided with the Commission, but the Ontario Court of Appeal reversed the decision and ordered the deposit to be paid back, so now the Commission is appealing to the Supreme Court.
	* Issues:
		* Does the mistake in the bid amount render the bid unacceptable, and therefore allows the return of the deposit despite the contractor refusing to carry out the contraction contract?
	* Rule/Ratio:
		* The application of forfeiture provisions in bids is not voided by mistakes or omissions in the bid/contract.
	* Reasoning:
		* Although the bid had a mistake, the contractor did intend to submit the bid.
		* There is no principle in law that renders the bid incapable of acceptance by the Commission, despite the existence of the mistake.
		* Therefore the terms of the contract still applied, and the condition for the Commission to retain the deposit was met, so the deposit does not need to be paid back.
	* Holding: The appeal was allowed -- the deposit does not need to be paid back.
