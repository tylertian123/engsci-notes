## Legal Citations

* *Neutral case citations* are citations that refer to a case, but not a specific reporter or database
	* This follows the format of `<appellant> v <defendant>, <year> <court> <decision number>`
	* e.g. "*R v Wood*, 2017 ONSC 3239"
		* "R" means the Crown
		* The first party is the appellant (the one bringing forward the case)
		* ONSC stands for Ontario Superior Court
		* The final number is the decision number
	* e.g. "*Advanced Process Solutions Inc v Delta-T Canada Corp*, 2011 SKCA 92"
		* This would be civil law
		* The first party is the applicant (bringing forward the case); the second party is the respondent/defendant
		* SKCA stands for Saskatchewan Court of Appeals
	* Citations beginning with "R" are criminal law cases, since the Crown prosecutor is the one bringing forward the case
	* "SCR" and "SCC" refer to Supreme Court of Canada decisions
* Citations can also contain the reporter, volume, and page number, e.g. "*Edgeworth Construction Ltd v ND Lea & Associates Ltd*, [1993] 3 SCR 206"
	* 3 is the volume and 206 is the first page of the decision
	* The same case can be reported by multiple reporters, e.g. this case can also be "8 WWR 129" (where WWR is the abbreviation for Western Weekly Reports)
* Legal citations should generally be included as footnotes to show the reasoning
	* Always cite when referencing a law, quoting, paraphrasing, summarizing, or when in doubt
* The McGill Guide is regarded as the authority for legal citations in Canada
* Tips for finding law:
	* Partial citations can be searched through CanLII
	* Ontario e-Laws has a summary of all the regulations under the Act
		* CanLII also has a tab for this
	* Regulations on CanLII will link to the statute that gives it power (and a tab that shows the enabling statute)
* Citations for statutes follow the format `<name>, <source> <year> <chapter/section/etc.>`, e.g. "Environmental Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.18"
	* "c." stands for chapter, "s." stands for section
	* "RSC" stands for Revised Statute of Canada ("RSO" for revised statute of Ontario)
* For regulations use the format `<name>, <province> Reg. <number>`, e.g. "Engineers and Geoscientists Regulation, BC Reg 14/2021"
