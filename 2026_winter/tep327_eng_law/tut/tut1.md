## Finding Applicable Law

* Start with division of powers, i.e. find the parties that have jurisdiction, federal, provincial, aboriginal, municipal, or administrative body
	* Look for cross-over between jurisdictions, e.g. going between provincial/national boundaries, transporting dangerous goods
* Find any relevant administrative bodies once the relevant laws are found
* Search for relevant statues (Acts, laws passed by federal/provincial government), regulations (Regs, passed by administrative bodies), guidelines (may or may not be binding) or practices (non-binding recommendations that can be quickly updated)
	* This goes in increasing order of details
* Note sometimes the date that a statue or regulation comes into effect is not the same as the date it receives assent or the date cited
* Also look for case law (issued by the court) or administrative decisions (by administrative bodies)
	* Administrative decisions can be appealed, which might result in them becoming case law in court
