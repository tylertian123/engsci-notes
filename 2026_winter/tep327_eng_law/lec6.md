## Contracts

* *Contracts* set out the rights, responsibilities, and liabilities of parties
	* Can be used to limit tort liability, e.g. *Swift v Tomecek Roney Little & Associates Ltd.*
	* Can be oral instead of written, except for some special types (e.g. mortgages, guarantees)
		* e.g. buying groceries at the store counts as a contract
	* Can have express (explicitly stated) or implied terms (e.g. a vehicle purchased will work)
	* Are enforceable
* Only parties privy to the contract can enforce its terms -- if someone did not sign, the contract cannot be enforced for them
* Contracts require 5 elements; lack of any of these elements invalidates the contract
	1. Offer and acceptance
		* Acceptance of a contract must be unequivocal (i.e. unambiguous)
		* Counteroffers count as rejections of the original offer, and an offer to replace the original contract
			* The original offer cannot be accepted again, since the counteroffer implies its rejection
	2. Capacity to contract (e.g. age, mental disabilities, but also who can sign within a corporation/partnership/etc)
		* Transient situations (e.g. being drunk) can be difficult to prove whether there was sufficient capacity
		* Sole proprietorships contract in the name of the proprietor
		* Corporations can contract since they are persons
			* The people with capacity to sign contracts is often outlined in the articles of incorporation
		* Partnerships are formed by a contract
		* Each partner has *ostensible authority* over other partners and the partnership, where if they sign a contract, others could be bound by it
			* Partnership agreements can outline who can sign contracts to mitigate this
	3. Consideration (parties have to be providing something of value to each other)
		* The value provided does not necessarily have to be equal
		* Note that giving up something (e.g. waiving the right to sue) counts as consideration
	4. Intention to create legal obligations
		* This is also related to capacity
	5. Lawful purpose
* Intent to create a contract is determined by the court based on course of conduct and/or written terms
	* An "agreement to agree" is not a contract
	* Letters of intent or memorandums of understanding (MOU) are not contracts and are not legally enforceable
		* If one party treats it as enforceable and act upon it, the court may determine it as enforceable based on the actions and knowledge of parties
* *Invitations to Treat* are calls for offers (e.g. advertisements, RFPs) and not offers
	* e.g. checking out at a cashier is inviting the cashier to offer
	* Not all contractual relationships need an invitation to treat, but the offer and acceptance are necessary
	* Generally, if saying "yes" results in a contract, then it's an offer, otherwise it's an invitation to treat
* A *tender* is an offer to bid or submit a quote on a project or contract (e.g. an RFP)
	* Tenders are usually done through a formal process
	* The bid or quote may be an offer which results in a contract if accepted
		* Often this is not the case however (e.g. multiple rounds of bid selection)
* Contracts can end in one of two ways:
	* Being void or voidable (the contract was never valid)
		* *Duress* is when a party is being forced to enter a contract against their will
		* *Unconscionability* is when the contract was found to not have a lawful purpose
		* Mistake and misrepresentation
	* Through termination of the agreement
		* *Frustration* of a contract means that it can no longer be fulfilled
		* Full and complete performance
		* Termination clauses
		* Breach (intentional or unintentional): when one or more of the parties fail to meet their obligations pursuant to the contract
			* Damages are awarded to compensate for the breach (monetary or other remedies, e.g. ordering specific performance/actions, in the case where the need is unique)
				* Can also be an injunction or declaratory order (the court setting out the rights and obligations of a party)
				* Defences can include:
					* Mitigation: the innocent party must have taken reasonable steps to minimize their loss
					* Remoteness: only damages foreseeable when the contract was formed are considered
					* Causation: only damages caused by the actual breach (and not speculative losses) are considered
			* What constitutes a breach is based on the facts, and is often disputed
			* The first party to breach the contract is the one responsible; once the first breach occurs, the contract ends, so the parties no longer have obligations after that
			* The test for whether a breach is substantial enough (a fundamental breach) amounts to whether it deprives the innocent party of "substantially the whole benefit of the contract"
			* The contract can outline fundamental terms that if unfulfilled, constitutes a fundamental breach
			* A breach can occur when there is an actual breach, or when one party says that they will be unable to perform the obligations at some point in the future (*anticipatory breach*)
				* The innocent party can claim damages at the time of notice, or when the other party actually stops performing the obligations
* Changes to contracts creates a new contract or contractual obligations, so the same principles regarding contract formation applies
	* Amendments still need fresh (not in the original contract) and mutual consideration; if one party requests more money to be offered, they must offer something additional in return
	* The original contract can set out terms on how the contract can be changed
* *Waiver* is when one party relieves the other party from performing all or part of the contract
	* *Estoppel* is the principle that the party waiving the right can no longer rely on it
	* This requires clear expression that the waiving party intended to wave its rights, and that the party benefiting from the wavier relied upon that waiver
* Exclusion clauses exclude certain damages or remedies
* Limitation clauses limit liability (e.g. to a low value) but do not entirely eliminate it
* Consequential damage clauses restricts the ability to claim for lost profits or other damages indirectly related to the claim being made
	* e.g. a developer building a website for a large company can use this to avoid being liable for any profits lost resulting from the website not functioning
