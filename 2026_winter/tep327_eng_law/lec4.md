## Torts

* *Torts* are private or civil wrong or injury for which a court will provide a remedy in the form of an action for damages; i.e. the tort gives the plaintiff the right to sue
* Two main categories:
	* Intentional torts: harms committed by one person against another
		* The plaintiff must establish that the defendants performed the act (*actus reus*) on a balance of probabilities
		* These acts can result in both civil and criminal cases
		* Note that this does not mean that the defendant need to have intended to cause the harm or consequences (*mens rea*), unlike in criminal court
			* In some cases it is still necessary to prove the intention to perform the action itself, while in others this is not required
		* Can include assault (threats) or battery (physical attacks), intentional infliction of mental suffering or emotional distress, false imprisonment, trespassing, theft, conversion, defamation, fraud, etc.
		* For some types of torts (e.g. defamations), in addition to monetary settlements it's possible to also get *injunctions*, which are court orders requiring a person to do or stop doing an action
		* *Strict liability* torts are ones with no defence -- the defendant is culpable as long as the act is committed, regardless of intention, or even precautions taken, i.e. there is no need to find a fault
	* Unintentional torts: unintentional acts that cause harm to others
		* *Nuisance* is when the defendant causes a substantial and unreasonable interference with the occupier's land or their use of their land
			* This is often a strict liability tort
			* Nuisance and negligence are often brought forward together, but nuisance is often much easier to prove

### Negligence

* *Negligence* is a type of unintentional tort, which occurs when the defendant causes damage to the plaintiff by failing to fulfill a duty of care
* It must be proven that:
	1. Defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care
	2. The defendants breached that duty
	3. The plaintiff suffered a loss
	4. The breach of duty was the proximate cause of the loss, and the loss would not have happened had the breach not occurred
* *Duty of care* depends on reasonable foreseeability and proximity (see Ontario Inc. v Totten Sims Hubicki Associates) -- e.g. who do you need to reasonably keep in mind when making the design?
	* Duty of care is more likely to exist when there is a relationship between the parties, e.g. a contract
		* This is why defining the scope of work is extremely important in contracts
	* Engineers can owe a duty of care beyond their clients
		* Duty to warn requires engineers to act even when they are not under contract
		* The manufacturer has a duty to the consumer
	* A *fiduciary duty* is a higher level of duty that requires one party to act solely in the best interest of the other, e.g. parent-child
	* *Learned intermediary* are persons which provide the products (e.g. doctor, dentist, engineer), which may owe a duty even though they did not design the product
* To establish breach, the court must decide upon an applicable *Standard of Care* and then decide whether it was breached
	* The standard of care is based on what a "reasonable and competent engineer" would have done in the situation, based on the state of the art at the time of the alleged breach (and not at the time of the lawsuit)
		* An error in judgement does not automatically mean negligence
	* The scope of the contract is vital to the standard of care
	* Documentation, quality control procedures etc can be used to prove due diligence
* It's possible to seek *contribution* (spreading out out the penalty over multiple parties based on how they are responsible) and *indemnity* (one party may shift the entire loss to another)
	* Parties being sued can seek *cross-claims* from each other to share the penalty
	* If one party has more ability to pay, the plaintiff may choose to seek more compensation from that party regardless of what the court determines to be the split of responsibility; this party may seek cross-claims to get the money from others
	* The parties being sued can also argue that the plaintiff partially caused their own loss so they have to pay less
* Contract limitation clauses can be used to limit negligence
* Courts may impose *vicarious liability* on an employer as even though the employer did not commit a wrongful act, they had the best chance of preventing it from happening
	* e.g. an employer being abused by their manager sues the manager and the company
* Note that this is distinct from criminal negligence
