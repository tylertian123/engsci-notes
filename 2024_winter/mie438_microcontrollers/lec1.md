## CPU Selection

* What do we need to look for when selecting a CPU?
	* Speed: clock rate, CPI (cycles per instruction), instruction length and complexity
	* Interfacing: GPIO count, I/O peripherals, etc
	* Other considerations: power consumption, size, in-system upgrade, hardware design features, cost
* There are also criteria external to the processor itself:
	* Design process: tools (assembler, debugger, compilers, code generators, etc), code base, training, availability
	* Production: availability (supply chain considerations), cost, suppliers, product maturity and lifetime
	* Design for future: in-system upgrade, replacement, failure rates and modes
