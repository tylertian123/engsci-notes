## Motivation Theory Continued (Process Theories)

* Expectancy theory: people act in a certain way based on an expectation that the act will be followed by an outcome; motivation is based on the attractiveness of the outcome
	* Comprised of 3 relationships:
		1. Effort-performance
		2. Performance-reward
		3. Reward-personal goals
	* Force: effort (e.g. studying) put in to a level 1 outcome (e.g. doing well in a course) -- how much effort you're putting in to arrive at the performance
	* Expectancy: the likelihood that putting in the effort is going to make you achieve the level 1 outcome
	* Valence: the expected value of that level 1 outcome -- how much impact does the reward have?
	* Instrumentality: the likelihood that a level 1 outcome would lead to the level 2 outcome (e.g. getting a 4.0)
	* Outcome: ultimately achieving your personal goals (e.g. getting into grad school)
* Equity theory: people are more satisfied and motivated when they perceive equity
	* Individuals are motivated to maintain an equitable exchange relationship
* Goal setting theory: goals are motivational when they are specific, challenging, and when organizational members are committed to them, and feedback about progress is provided
	* You have to actively want the goal for this to work -- this is a theory of intrinsic motivation
	* Goals are more effective with:
		1. Specificity and difficulty
			* "Do your best" is not good enough because it's ambiguous
			* No target performance leads to low performance
		2. Knowledge to attain it
			* Training and setting learning goals can increase knowledge on how to attain the ultimate goal
		3. Feedback on progress towards the goal
		4. Commitment
		5. Situational conditions
	* A *distal* goal is a long-term or end goal (e.g. becoming a professor); a *proximal* goal is a short-term or sub-goal that is instrumental for achieving a distal goal (e.g. submitting a paper)
	* Learning goals are a type of sub-goal
	* Performance goals are either performance prove (doing something to prove you're capable of it) goals or performance avoid goals (doing something to avoid negative outcomes)
* Job design (the structure, content, and configuration of a person's tasks and roles) can also be a motivator, more focused on intrinsic motivation
	* Stretch assignments: providing employees challenging opportunities broaden their skills, and introducing variety to tasks and responsibilities
		* Getting an employee with the necessary base skills to try a new set of responsibilities
	* Job rotation: employees are rotated to different tasks and jobs in an organization
	* Job enrichment: maintaining the same job but giving employees more value/meaning of their jobs
		* e.g. more diversity in the tasks within the same area of responsibility
	* Job enlargement: increasing breadth by giving employees more tasks to perform at the same level
	* The last two focus on the *job scope*, or the breadth (number of different activities) and depth (degree of control) of the job
		* High-scope jobs have great breadth and depth
