## Leadership

* Leadership is about motivating people, gaining their commitment and directing them towards a goal
* Leaders are proactive and creates the vision, as opposed to managers who uphold the status quo and implements the vision
	* Leaders need to be passionate about their work
	* Goals are a lot more personal for leaders
* There are 2 types of leaders: "footsteps" (using position to guide and develop followers) and "shadows" (using position to satisfy their own needs, leaving followers in the dark)
