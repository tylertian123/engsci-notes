## Salary Negotiation Basics

* Preparation
	* Do research on the typical salaries expected
	* Ask about what is expected
	* There 2 types of negotiations: distributive (zero-sum -- one winner) and integrative (positive sum -- mutual gains)
	* 3 types of outcomes:
		* Perfect outcome
		* Best available alternative (BATNA) is something you would be okay with
		* Worst available alternative (WATNA)
* Acknowledgement
	* After receiving the offer, acknowledge it and express interest and gratitude, but don't immediately accept the offer because you need time to read through it carefully
	* "I will take some time to review and respond"
	* Use this offer to pressure other companies giving offers
	* Understanding the deadline for acceptance
* Planning
	* Be comfortable with the medium you're using -- in person, over a call, by email
	* Write out your plan and what you intend to argue
	* Have clear expectations of what you want
	* Zone of potential agreement (ZOPA) is the space between the two parities' *reservation points* (i.e. the range between the employer's max possible offer and your minimum possible acceptance point)
		* The target point is the realistic goal
		* The aspiration point is the optimistic goal
		* The resistance point is an outcome below which you will not go
		* Each party has an initial offer/asking price
	* Expanding the pie: what about other benefits?
		* Employers can have other methods of motivating a potential hire, e.g. bonuses, vacation, education/tuition, pension plans
		* Try to push for more vacation days (usually starting at 2 weeks minimum)
	* Go into the negotiation with the power to walk away -- this can be another offer, or an alternative plan (the BATNA)
	* Strategies:
		* Dig for information to find the opponent's resistance point, to push for a settlement near that
		* Prove your value to the opponent to get them to push their resistance point (e.g. degrees, experiences)
		* Convince the other party that the settlement is the best possible
		* If you have an alternative offer, use it as leverage -- mention it or imply it
		* Source of power can include information (what did they pay others), position in an organization, relationship-based sources, contextual sources
	* Tactics both sides might use:
		* Lowballing (providing an offer significantly lower expectation/industry standard)
		* Bogey (playing up a different factor to distract from what you really want)
		* The nibble (using small concessions, moving the offer by a little bit)
		* Intimidation/aggressive behaviour
		* Snow job (overwhelming the opponent with information)
* Negotiation
	* Be realistic about what you expect
	* Share but don't overshare
	* Make sure the negotiation is done in a friendly way
