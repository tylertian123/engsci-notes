## Self-Awareness & Personality

* A person's tendency toward *thinking, behaving and feeling* in consistent ways across different types of situations and time
	* Approach to interaction (behaviour)
	* Approach to perception/processing information (thinking)
	* Approach to interpreting and reacting (feeling)
* As an observer, what you see of others is the behavioural component of their personality
	* You don't see how they think -- this is more hidden
	* Sometimes you can interpret how they feel
* The "Big Five" ("OCEAN") model
	* Openness: imagination, feelings actions, ideas
		* High scoring individuals are more curious and adventurous
		* Low scoring individuals are more practical and routine oriented, likes consistency
	* Conscientiousness: competence, self-discipline, thoughtfulness and goal-drivenness
		* High scorers have responsibility, accountability and dependability
		* Low scorers are impulsive, careless and disorganized
	* Extroversion: social, assertiveness, emotional expression
	* Agreeableness: cooperativeness, trustworthiness
		* High scorers are more helpful and cooperative, even at their own detriment
		* Low scorers are more suspicious of others and more critical
	* Neuroticism: opposite of emotional stability
		* Emotional stability is our ability to manage our emotions
		* Knowing when to release those emotions
* Some factors in the OCEAN model are closely correlated, e.g. openness and agreeableness; this could be a limitation
* When society has expectations for us that differ from what we actually are, we push ourselves in that direction
* Personality does change, but it's typically a stable trait
	* Personality is complex
* Behaviour is the observable component of personality
	* Behaviour is influenced by personality and other factors such as the current environment

### The Person-Situation Debate

* How do we draw conclusions from what we see about the behaviour of a person?
* There are 3 approaches:
	1. Dispositional approach: focuses on individual dispositions and personality
		* "everything is associated with personality"
		* e.g. when someone is late consistently, it is because they are low on conscientiousness
	2. Situational approach: individuals' behaviour are more motivated by reward and punishment
		* Based on research
		* The situation or external factors cause their behaviour to unfold this way
		* e.g. the individual will stop showing up late if they are rewarded for being on time or punished for being late
	3. Interactionist approach: considers both the situation and personality
		* Situations can be described as either "weak" or "strong"
			* "Weak" situations have loosely defined roles and rules, weak reward and punishment; in this situation personality has the strongest effect
			* "Strong" situations have more defined roles and rules, stronger reward and punishment; in this situation personality has less of an impact
		* Some personality characteristics are useful in certain situations
		* There is no one "best" personality, rather it's important to see who "fits" the best

## Self-Awareness

* Self-awareness allows us to collect observations about how we're feeling
	* Understanding how you behave under pressure
* Self-awareness facilitates development of interpersonal skills and allow you to manage yourself
	* Learn about how you're going to adapt and engage with others in the workplace
	* Setting appropriate goals and management of stress
	* To know what's expected of us and how to respond
	* Improve performance
* Being self-aware also requires you to be aware of how others are feeling
* Self awareness concepts:
	* Locus of control: internal locus of control means you feel you have control; external locus of control means you feel passive
		* You may change between two sides of the spectrum
	* Self-esteem:
		* Negative feedback to people with lower self-esteem leads to lower performance
		* Self-esteem is an aspect of emotional stability; lower levels of neuroticism is correlated with higher self-esteem
	* Individuals with general self-efficacy tend to have good bounceback
	* Individuals with core self-evaluations can better evaluate their self-worth
	* Emotions and moods are affects; they are how we experience things
		* Our dispositions predict our general emotional tendencies impacting our mood and emotions
		* Positive affectivity involves viewing things in a positive light (opposite for negative)
* Interpersonal skills involve:
	* Social skills
		* Interpersonal competence, put oneself in the place of another person and try to understand what they expect
	* Self-monitoring
		* Incorporate information about others' expectations in one's subsequent behaviour
		* "Reading the room" and reacting accordingly
	* Self-control
		* Stay focused on others' expectations
		* Limiting yourself, delaying gratification
