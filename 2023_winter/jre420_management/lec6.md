## Learning

* Any process through which practice or exercise at one time can alter an individual's behavior at another time
* We learn actively and constantly
* 3 kinds of learning experience:
	* Classical conditioning
		* Pavlov's dog
			* Initially conditioned stimulus is the food, unconditioned response is the drool
			* When the food is removed, the drool becomes a conditioned response
	* Operant learning
		* Positive/negative reinforcement
	* Social Cognitive Theory
		* Learning on the job

### Operant Learning

* Learning in which the subject learns to operate on the environment to achieve certain consequences
	* We are controlled by the consequences of our behaviour
	* Subject learns a connection between certain behaviour and certain consequences that follow
	* We are aiming to increase probability of desirable behaviours and eliminate or reduce probability of undesirable behaviour
* Both positive and negative reinforcement aims to increase positive behaviour:
	* Positive reinforcement is the application or *addition* of a stimulus that increases or maintains the probability of some behaviour
		* e.g. "employee of the month" -- recognition for good behaviour increases good behaviour
		* The stimulus is the positive reinforcer
		* The reinforcer is dependent or contingent on the occurrence of the desired behaviour
	* Negative reinforcement is the *removal* of a stimulus that increases or maintains the probability of some behaviour
		* It is not punishment; negative reinforcement is removing a barrier to increase good behaviour
		* e.g. parents stop nagging a child when the child does the desired action
		* When a response prevents some event or stimulus from occurring
		* The removed or prevented stimulus is a negative reinforcer
* Reinforcement has limitations:
	* Consistency in applying the stimulus is needed
	* Someone needs to enforce the rules
* To reduce undesirable behaviour, two strategies can be used:
	* Extinction: *removing* the reinforcer
		* e.g. moving a student when they are talking in class means they can no longer engage in the undesirable behaviour
	* Punishment: *applying* a negative stimulus
* The difference between positive/negative reinforcement and punishment/extinction is the end goal: whether to increase or decrease the behaviour
* Problems using punishment:
	* Does not demonstrate what should be done, only what shouldn't be done
	* Provokes a strong emotional reaction from the subject
	* Suppression of behaviour is temporary

### Social Cognitive Theory

* Focuses on giving choice and autonomy, choice and independence (but can't be applied in all scenarios)
* Paying attention to how someone else is doing it (attentional processes), retaining some of that information (retention processes), carrying it out yourself (production processes), and checking it against a model (reinforcement)
* This method of learning builds *self-efficacy*: confidence to successfully perform a task
* *Self-regulation* involves:
	* Collect self-observation data
	* Observe models
	* Set goals
	* Rehearse
	* Reinforce oneself
	* Compare to goals

### Organizational Behavior Modification

* Organizational learning practices:
	* OB modification
	* Employee recognition programs
		* e.g. "employee of the month"
	* Training programs
	* Career development
