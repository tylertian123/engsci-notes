## Electric Flux Density and Polarization

* $D = \varepsilon _r\varepsilon _0\vec E = \varepsilon _r\varepsilon _0(\vec E_0 - \vec E_p), \varepsilon _r = \chi _e + 1, \vec P = \varepsilon _0\chi _e\vec E = \varepsilon _0(\varepsilon _r - 1)\vec E$
* $\chi _e = \frac{\rho _{sb}}{\varepsilon _0(E_0 - E_p)} = \frac{\rho _{sb}}{\rho _s - \rho _{sb}}$
* $\varepsilon _r = \chi _e + 1 = \frac{\rho _s}{\rho _s - \rho _{sb}}$
* $\vec D = \left(\frac{\rho _s}{\rho _s - \rho _{sb}}\right)\varepsilon _0\left(\frac{\rho _s}{\varepsilon _0} - \frac{\rho _{sb}}{\varepsilon _0}\right) = \rho _s$
	* Note this is for a flat plate capacitor
* In the end the electric flux density relates only to the free charge, but the electric field relates to both free and bound charge
* Therefore $\vec D = \varepsilon _0\varepsilon _r\vec E = \varepsilon _0\vec E + \vec P$
	* Note $\vec D$ is not something *changed* by polarization; rather it is the total field $\vec E$ that changes
	* The combination of changing $\vec E$ and polarization $\vec P$ produces a constant $\vec D$, unaffected by dielectric changes
* $\vec D$ is the *electric flux density* or *electric displacement vector*
	* $\vec D$ is completely material independent
	* $\vec D$ represents the flow, or flux, of the "presence" of charge -- it is connected only to the source of the field (i.e. the free charges)
		* This is why $\oiint _S \vec D \cdot \dd\vec S = Q_{enc}$
* $\vec E$ is the *electric field intensity*
	* It relates to the total charge, both free and bound
	* $\vec E$ comes from the electric force per unit charge
	* $\vec E$ represents the effects of the entire field with all of its charges/forces
