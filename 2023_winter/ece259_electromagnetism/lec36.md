## Maxwell's Contribution -- Displacement Current

* Ampere's law breaks down when we consider a simple circuit with a capacitor and a surface through the middle of the capacitor
* A new type of "current" has to be considered -- the *displacement current*

\noteDefn{The displacement current is defined as $$\vec J_d = \pdiff{\vec D}{t}$$ with Ampere's law becoming $$\del \times \vec H = \vec J + \vec J_d$$ or in the integral form: $$\oint _C \vec H \cdot \dd\vec l = \iint _S \left(\vec J + \pdiff{\vec D}{t}\right)\cdot\dd\vec s = I_c + I_d$$}

* The displacement current was initially an educated guess by Maxwell which was experimentally verified later
* Unlike $\vec J$, the displacement current $\vec J_d$ is not due to the movement of charges
* This now allows the existence of electromagnetic waves -- a change in $\vec D$ induces a change in $\vec H$ by Ampere's law, and a change in $\vec H$ induces a change in $\vec D$ by Faraday's law
