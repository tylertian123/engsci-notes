## Field Computation Using Gauss's Law

* Using Gauss's law we can solve for the field from the charge distribution, but only if we know the nature of the field beforehand
* We have to make two assumptions:
	1. What components does the field have?
	2. How does the field magnitude change with space? (i.e. Which variables is it a function of?)
* From these questions we can determine the different regions we have to evaluate Gauss's law on and what kind of Gaussian surface is needed
	* A *Gaussian surface* is an imaginary surface on which we find the flux
	* We must choose the Gaussian surface wisely to make questions solvable at all; to do this we need to make use of symmetry
* In order of bring $\vec D$ out of the flux integral $\oiint _S \vec D \cdot \dd\vec S = Q_{enc}$, we need:
	1. $S$ has to be closed
	2. $S$ has to be oriented such that $\vec D \cdot \dd\vec S = 0$ or $D\,\dS$
	3. Over points where $\vec D \cdot \dd\vec S = D\,\dS$, $\norm{\vec D}$ should be constant
