## Laplace's and Possion's Equations

* Since $\del \cdot \vec D = \rho _v$, we have $\del \cdot (\varepsilon\vec E) = \rho _v$
* $\del \times \vec E = 0 \implies \vec E = -\del V$
* Combining these we get Possion's equation: $\del \cdot (\varepsilon\del V) = -\rho _v$
* In the case where $\rho _v = 0$ we get Laplace's equation: $\del \cdot (\varepsilon\del V) = 0$
* If the electric field is homogeneous, then we may take out $\varepsilon$ and get $\del \cdot \del V = -\frac{\rho _v}{\varepsilon} \implies \del^2 V = -\frac{\rho _v}{\varepsilon}$

\noteEqn{Possion's equation: $$\del \cdot (\varepsilon\del V) = -\rho _v$$ In a homogeneous material, this reduces to $$\del^2 V = -\frac{\rho _v}{\varepsilon}$$ Where there is no charge density, these are called Laplace's equations}
