## Effect of Electric Field on Materials

* If an external electric field is applied to a material, then "excess" or "mobile" charges will be pushed along by the field
* Based on the amount of mobile charges, most materials fall into 3 categories: conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics (insulators)
	* In a conductor the band gap is very small so very little energy is needed to promote an electron to the conduction band
	* In a dielectric the band gap is quite large, so a lot of energy is needed for conduction
* The movement of charges creates a current $I$; we can define a *current density* $J$ so that $I = \iint _S \vec J \cdot \dd\vec S$
	* $\vec J$ has units of $\si{A/m^2}$

\noteEqn{The relationship between current density and an electric field causing the current is $$\vec J = \sigma\vec E$$ where $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the material}

* This is known as Ohm's law in microscopic (point) form
* Conductivity characterizes how easily a current flows within that material
	* Later we see $\sigma = \frac{N_ee^2\tau}{m_e}$ where $N_e$ is the electron density and $\tau$ is the mean free time
	* In general $\sigma$ goes down as temperature goes up as $\tau$ decreases when the atoms become more energetic
* Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity, $\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}$ with units of $\si{\ohm.m}$
* Properties of perfect conductors and dielectrics:
	* In a perfect conductor, $\sigma \to \infty$, so no applied field is needed for current to flow, and *there is always zero electric field*
	* In a perfect insulator, $\sigma \to 0$, so there is never any current; the electric field can be anything but the material will not respond
* A perfect conductor will have the same potential everywhere on its surface, so all perfect conducting surfaces are equipotential; therefore the electric field is always perpendicular to them
