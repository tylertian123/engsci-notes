## Magnetostatics

* The magnetic field intensity $\vec B$ is created by a current $I$ according to the right hand rule; the field forms a loop around the current-carrying conductor}
* A fundamental postulate is $\del \cdot B = 0$; this means that the magnetic field intensity vector always forms closed loops
* By convention, $\vec B$ emanates from the *north* pole and ends at the *south* pole

\noteDefn{The Lorentz force law: The force felt by a charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec u$ in a magnetic field $\vec B$ is $$\vec F_m = q\vec u \times \vec B$$ \tcblower This makes the total force on a charge moving in an electric and magnetic field $$\vec F = \vec F_e + \vec F_m = q\vec E + q\vec u \times \vec B$$}

* Note that a charge that is not moving does not feel any magnetic force; also since the magnetic force is normal to the direction of velocity, the magnetic force cannot change the speed, only the direction of a moving charge
* For a current carrying wire, $q\vec u = \int I\,\dd\vec l = I\vec L$ so $\vec F_m = I\vec L \times \vec B$
	* Therefore two parallel wires will attract each other if they carry currents in the same direction, and repel each other if they carry currents in different directions
