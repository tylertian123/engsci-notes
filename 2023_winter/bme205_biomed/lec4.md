## Transfer RNA (tRNA) and Translation

* Translation is the process of building proteins
* tRNA forms tertiary structures
* tRNAs are about 4 times smaller than ribosomes (7nm vs 30nm) and they can interact
* The ribosome consists of RNA coiled together with proteins
* The ribosome reads a messenger RNA and makes proteins
	* Transfer RNAs have anticondons that match codons on the mRNA
	* Each tRNA has an amino acid which is used to build the final protein
* Every group of 3 bases form a *codon*; condon charts tell us which condon is formed by a combination of 3 bases
	* e.g. an AUG sequence forms a methionine, which is the "start" condon; UAA, UAG, and UGA are the "stop" codons
* The tRNA gets attached to the amino acid through other molecules
* The process:
	* Initiation: the AUG codon gets read, translation starts
	* Elongation: the next tRNA enters and grows the chain of amino acids; the previous tRNA gets ejected and a new one flies in and repeats
	* Termination: there is no amino acid attached to the tRNA with anticondon matching the "stop" codon, so the translation stops there; tRNAs are ejected and the protein is detached

\noteSummary{
Transcription and Translation: Summary
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Aleration in chromatin structure (DNA uncoils)
	\item Initiation of transcription by positive transcription factors and enchancers attracting DNA polymerase
	\item Transcript elongation: the RNA is built one base at a time
	\item Termination of transcription
	\item RNA processing: introns are removed, leaving only the exons
	\item Nucleocytoplasmic transport: RNA is transported out of the nucleus
	\item Translation: protein is built from amino acids by ribosomes using tRNAs and mRNAs
	\item RNA degradation
\end{enumerate}
