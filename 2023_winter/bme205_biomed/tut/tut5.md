## Facilitated Diffusion

* Transporters can move either 1 or two types of solutes at a time
	* A *uniport* transports 1 specific solute
	* A *cotransport* transports 2 different solutes at the same time; both need to be present for transport to function
		* A *symport* transports them in the same direction
		* An *antiport* transports them in opposite directions
			* These are required to overcome the electrical work of transporting a single ion across the membrane
* Uniporters, antiporters and symporters are all active transporters
	* Antiporters are the ones that transport sodium out and potassium in (potassium-sodium-ATPase pumps)
