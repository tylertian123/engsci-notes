## Project Management

* Multiple teams are often working on different parts of the project, possibly around the world. How do we deal with complex design situations?
	* Clear chain of command
	* Clearly communicated goals/expectations/timelines
	* Accountability
	* Organized communication channels
	* Frequent debrief meetings
	* Organization of roles/responsibilities/expertise
* Effective project team collaboration involves both team process and design process
	* A team charter guides everything the team does
	* A communication protocol is needed for decision making, conflict management, information management, and team interactions
	* Regular team meetings, with agendas, notes and action items
	* The meetings operationalize, track, and record technical design artefacts
	* Project schedule, tasks list, procurement and budget tracker
	* Project document repository to keep all these
	* Process review includes consideration for decisions, justification for updates, reflections and lessons learned
* Teamwork is framed by a team charter:
	* Team identity: common goals, shared values, mission, and expectations
	* Communication protocols: suitable collaboration platforms, communication practices and appropriate information exchange
	* Interaction protocols: decision-making, negotiation of priorities, conflict management, relationship building
* Team meetings progress the design work:
	* Meeting agenda: clear focus and expectations, maximize time usage
	* Meeting notes: track deign progress, common understanding, clear interpretations, gather information, transparency, audit trail
	* Action items: track tasks, capture roles & responsibilities, avoid duplication, transparency, audit trail
* Process reviews improve the design work:
	* Justifications and considerations: considerations for decisions, justifications for updates, reasons for team actions
	* Reflections: Design work experiences, teamwork experiences & behaviours, achievements, challenges, future implications
	* Lessons learned: knowledge gained, desired/undesired outcomes, future modifications
		* Look at the process and modify the team charter
* PM artifacts in dossier:
	* Team charter
		* Team identity
		* Communication protocol
		* Interaction protocol
	* Meeting agendas
	* Meeting notes and action item
	* Team building activities
	* Meeting recordings (one in each phase)
* Project duties and responsibilities are tracked via meeting notes, recordings, etc

## Value Propositions: Opportunity to Approach

* Main framework is the *design chain*
	* Each part works in a space, which has *dimensions of consideration*
		* e.g. individuals, groups, social structure in the context
		* e.g. tasks addressed, degree of automation, human-technology interaction for approaches
	* Value propositions link one space to another
* A value proposition describes the benefit customers can expect from your design
	* Links the opportunity space to the specific approach you take to provide value to stakeholders in that context
* Value propositions help define scope
	* From potential gains and current pains value propositions extract value
	* Are you creating new capabilities or addressing problems?
* There are multiple possible value propositions
* Go from context to approaches and then to design concepts, don't jump directly to design concepts
* Value propositions may affect different stakeholders differently
* Think about who are the stakeholders; who will you provide value for? **who will you leave out?**
