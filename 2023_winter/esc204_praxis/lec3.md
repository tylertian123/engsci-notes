## Design Dossier Assignment

* Artifacts are evidence of your work, e.g. meeting minutes, schematics, CAD, code versions
* The dossier includes an integrated summary that tells the assessor where and what things are
* Document everything, notes, pictures, other records
	* Meeting minutes are required!
* Consider an engineering notebook

## Context Research

* Separate the design and the context, e.g. the design is helicopter, the context is on Mars
	* The context needs to be fully understood before we look at the design
	* Once you start looking at the design you're locked in
* Stay open-ended in the initial steps of context research to gather more than enough information about the social and cultural context
* For designs involving a community, the following areas may be included:
	* Culture (art and literature, customs, symbols)
	* History
	* Political systems/government
	* Economics
	* Natural environment
	* Geology
	* Demographics
	* etc
* *Open-ended* research is characterized by a persistent degree of uncertainty about why you're doing the research -- the "why" appears later
	* This makes it hard to judge what information is important
* How will your **design** survive in the **world**?
	* Survive in a society, with people? For days/year/decades? From repair, funding, attention or use?
	* Can the community support the energy requirements? Is there government infrastructure or outside funding for repair? Does your stakeholder have the knowledge to fix it when it breaks? Will the design deepen social divisions to the point that the design is regretted?
