# Verification

* Autonomous operation -- will it respond consistently and as expected without intervention?
* Robustness -- working consistently under rougher conditions, variations in expected inputs, etc
	* Repeated measurements for consistency separates tests from demo
* Reliability -- will the device break after many operation cycles?
* Repeatability -- will it work many times in the same way?
* Rubric:
	* Developing: Do you at least have a plan?
		* Standards/codes are not always necessary but you need to make sure your tests make sense
	* Developed: When you have a plan, put it in motion
	* High quality: Now that you have your data, interpret it -- what does it mean for your design?
		* Insights gained should enhance your understanding of the design concept
* Systematic testing:
	* Have a plan
	* Record results in detail
	* Repeat testing
		* Confirm the validity of your tests early on
	* Interpret results
* What to test?
	* Recognize that your prototype is not the same as your design concept
	* Try to connect tests using proxies to the high-level requirements
	* Test according to specification

# Visual Abstract

* A series of figures with connecting text, or even visual only -- figures should tell the whole story
* Provide a brief and engaging summary of the outcomes (less of the process)
* Focus on the design concept, the framing, the values provided
* Focus on either or both of the concept and the prototype (the prototype that you actually built, not the ones that didn't work out)
* Only one page but we can have multiple figures with connecting text
* Avoid:
	* Drawings that are more artistic than informative
		* Is everything communicating something?
		* Have someone look at the visual and then tell you what they're learning from it
	* Generic visuals of electromechanical components
		* Don't just put in generic engineering-y images
		* Actually show your concept
