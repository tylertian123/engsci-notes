## Prototyping

* Use proxies for parts that are too complicated
	* Good for stuff that are for communication, e.g. using a water bottle as the proxy for a patient
* Don't have to build or proxy every part of the system!
* Can be a scale model
* Show a particular aspect of the concept, or integration between concepts
* Selecting elements:
	* What is the highest risk part?
	* What functions are critical?
	* How does it interface with other elements of the context and is it possible to prototype that?
