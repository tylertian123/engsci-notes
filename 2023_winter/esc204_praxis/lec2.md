## Prototyping

* A model that demonstrates part(s)/concepts of the finished product
	* Could be physical, mathematical, graphical, etc
	* Serves a purpose -- communicate, demonstrate, de-risk, and verify
* Prototyping is a process:
	1. Conceptualize/express/sketch ideas at a very high level
	2. Specify and flesh out details via CAD, pseudocode, schematics, etc to enable verification
	3. Building the prototype
	4. Evaluate the prototype, check against the concept and/or specification
* Systems Theory/Thinking Framework for Prototyping: Systems have a functional perspective, e.g. change in state to change of output, state machines, and a structural perspective, e.g. how parts connect together
