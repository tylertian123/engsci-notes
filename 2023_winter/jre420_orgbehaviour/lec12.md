## Attitudes

* A fairly stable evaluative tendency to respond consistently to some object, situation, person, or category of people
* Attitudes are influenced by values, beliefs, and behaviour
	* Values and beliefs create attitudes, which then influence behaviour
	* e.g. "job interfering with family" (belief) + "value in family" (value) combine to create the attitude of disliking the job, which influences the behaviour of searching for another job
* Attitudes are built through events and influence behaviour 
	* e.g. a negative experience in a course creates a negative attitude to the course, causing showing up to class miserable and not paying attention

## Job Satisfaction

* Job satisfaction facets are a collection of attitudes that workers have about their jobs; this can include:
	* The work itself
	* Compensation
	* Career growth opportunities
	* Supervisor, coworkers
	* Policies
	* Working conditions
* Overall job satisfaction is an average of the attitudes towards these facets
* Job satisfaction has 4 determinants:
	* Discrepancies
		* What do we think we deserve vs. what we get
		* Comparing your own inputs to your own outputs
	* Mood & emotions
		* An affect is a broad label for feelings that includes emotions and moods
			* Emotions are intense and short-term
			* Moods are less intense but longer lived
		* When there is a negative mood going around in the workplace, it influences everyone -- the mood can propagate
			* e.g. a loud confrontation between a manager and employee affects all other employees that see it; the confrontation itself is an emotion, but after it's over, a mood of tension sets in
	* Fairness
		* Distributive fairness: Comparing your input/output and others' input/outputs
			* Equivalent inputs should result in the same outcomes
			* Equity theory
		* Procedural fairness: Fairness in the processes used
		* Interactional fairness: Fairness when people feel that they have received respectful and informative communication about an outcome
			* We feel we need to advocate for ourselves when we see we're treated differently
			* Are people treated with politeness, dignity, and respect?
	* Dispositions
		* Some people are predisposed by virtue of their personalities to be more or less satisfied despite changes in discrepancy or fairness
		* e.g. extraversion, conscientiousness, self-esteem, etc are positively correlated with satisfaction; neuroticism is negatively correlated
