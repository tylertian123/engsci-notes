## Organizational Behaviour

* Organizations are groups of people working together for a common goal
	* A social invention
	* The objective needs to be something that society wants
	* Even if it's only one person, that can be an organization if the person is working towards an objective
* The field of organizational behaviour has 3 common goals:
	1. Prediction
		* e.g. picking who to hire out of a pool of applicants
			* From an equity perspective, being consistent is important (everyone needs to get the same questions for the same role)
		* Predictions come from experience, e.g. preferring to hire from a certain university because these individuals have been more competent in the past
	2. Explanation
	3. Management
* Many methods are used: observations, interviews, surveys, experiments, etc
* OB has many critical applications, e.g. managing medical professionals
* We can make observations through statistical correlations, e.g. pay incentives and individual productivity, but it's important to note correlation does not imply causation
* OB creates positive work environments that contribute to employee health and wellness, thus increasing productivity
	* Note well-being is an *affect* (it is long-lasting), whereas happiness is a temporary emotion
	* "Creating an environment in which you are better able to succeed"

## Psychological Capital (PsyCap)

* An important contributor to employee success and well-being
* Refers to 4 factors (HERO):
	* Hope
		* Charting a course towards a goal
		* Persevering toward one's goals and using multiple pathways to achieve one's goals
	* (Self-)Efficacy
		* When we're confident, we're willing to be seen
		* Confidence to take on and put in effort
	* Resilience
		* Ability to bounce back from setbacks
	* Optimism
		* Internal attributions about positive events in the present and future
		* External attributions about negative events
		* Knowing your ability and also what's outside your control
* PsyCap is a resource that organizations provide us with to support us
* In practice, meta-studies show a high correlation between PsyCap and satisfaction, commitment, etc
