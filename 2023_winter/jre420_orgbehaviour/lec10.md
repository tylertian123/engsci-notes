## Discrimination Continued

* Types of (intentional) discrimination:
	* Discriminatory policies or practices: action directly taken by the organization
	* Sexual harassment
	* Intimidation: intentional discrimination, explicit threats, bullying etc
	* Mockery and insults: often jokes taken too far
	* Exclusion
	* Incivility: disrespectful treatment, including aggression, interrupting, ignoring, etc
* In different jurisdictions there are criminally prohibited grounds of discrimination outlined by law

## Fairness

* What is fairness? Everyone values fairness, but how do we ensure fairness?
	* Fairness in measurement refers to the value judgements people make about the decisions or outcomes that are based on measurements
	* An unbiased measure may still be unfair
* KSA stands for knowledge, skills and abilities
* A bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) is a requirement for a job that is necessary; classifying a characteristic as a BFOR allows you to discriminate based on that characteristic
	* "Justifiable reason for discrimination"
	* e.g. vision standards for a bus driver
* Reasonable accommodation the idea that adjustments of the workplace has to be made to reasonably accommodate an employee
	* e.g. someone who's worked in the company where their eyesight deteriorated, the employer has to accommodate for this
	* If the employer is limited in their ability to accommodate the individual, then the characteristic is a BFOR
	* The employer has to accommodate the individual up to the point of *undue hardship*
	* Tests for undue hardship:
		1. Financial costs make it impossible
		2. Cant rely on outside sources of funding (e.g. government)
		3. Creates a challenge to health and safety requirements

## Disability

* A basis determined by the courts, not necessarily the individual workplace
* The employers face a question of substantive sense -- is burden imposed or benefit withheld?
* Who has to prove that a disability is there? What counts/does not count as a disability?

## Values

* Values inform our biases and actions; they are part of what motivates us
* Sometimes we learn what we value through deficiencies in ourselves or others -- we can learn what we like or what we don't like
* Different generations tend to have different values, but generational stereotypes exist
	* How do these differences in values impact how we work together in the workplace?
* Culture also influences our values
	* Culture consists of transitional ideas and values; patterned ways of thinking, feeling, and reacting
* Work centrality: different cultures value work differently
	* For some people work is integral to the way they engage; for others it is less important
	* Do you live to work or work to live?
* Geert Hofstede discovered 4+ basic dimensions of culture:
	* Power distance: level of unequal distribution of power (acceptance by members of the society)
		* In a more equal society, there is less power distance
	* Individualism vs. Collectivism: individualistic societies stress independence and individual initiative; collective cultures favour interdependence and loyalty
	* Masculinity vs. Femininity: masculine cultures support defined gender roles and stress the dominance of a gender; feminine cultures accept fluid and open gender roles and gender equality
	* Uncertainty avoidance: level of comfort with uncertain and ambiguous situations
		* Cultures with more rules and customs tend to avoid uncertainty
	* Time orientation: long-term time orientation emphasizes persistence and the future
		* e.g. long-term well-being, education
		* Can effect economics as well, e.g. investment in infrastructure
	* Indulgence: how much people control their desires and impulses
		* Indulgent cultures encourage doing things for pleasure, joy and mutual satisfaction
		* Lower levels of control for behaviours
* Organizations need to tailor management practices to the home culture's concerns
	* Globalization has brought management practices from other parts of the world, but different cultures view work differently (work centrality)
