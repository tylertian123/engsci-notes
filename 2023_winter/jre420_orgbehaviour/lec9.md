## Biases

* The impressions we form of others are susceptible to a number of perceptual biases
* Factors of social identity can be used for people to project their biases
* Biases serve as more efficient shortcuts to save us time and from danger
	* However this makes us misunderstand and misjudge people, even when they haven't earned it
* People have implicit theories about which characteristics go together
	* e.g. short and silver hair means little kind old lady
	* This is not often true, which leads to stereotypes
* Stereotypes are our tendency to generalize about people in a social category and ignore variations among them

## Attribution

* The process by which we assign causes or motives to explain people's behaviour
	* e.g. attributing behaviour to traits of personality
	* Rewards and punishments are based on judgements about what really caused people to behave in a certain way
		* e.g. participation marks for attending class
	* An important goal is to determine whether some behaviour is caused by dispositional (internal) or situational (external) factors
* We rely on external cues and make inferences from these cues to make attributions
	* Does the person engage in the behaviour *consistently*?
		* Consistency points towards dispositional factors
	* Do most people engage in the behaviour (*consensus*), or is it unique to this person?
		* Consensus points towards situational factors
	* Does the person engage in the behaviour in many situations, or is it *distinctive* to one situation?
		* Distinctiveness points towards situational factors

### Biases in Attribution

* Attributions are not always correct; there are 3 types of biases in attribution:
	* Fundamental attribution error: overemphasizing dispositional explanations
		* e.g. a person is active in a class not because of the nature of the class but because they are an extravert
		* Overestimating of the influence of personality and underestimating situational factors
		* Failure to observe distinction
	* Actor-observer effect: looking at someone's behaviour and making an attribution that's different from what we would associate with if we were in the situation ourselves
		* e.g. when we're late, we attribute it to situational factors, but when other people are late we think they are lazy
		* Actors are prone to attribute their own behaviour to situational factors while observers are more likely to invoke dispositional causes
	* Self-serving bias: how we explain our own behaviour differently
		* Reflects intentional or natural self-promotion, and underestimates situational factors
		* e.g. attributing success in a course to being smart, not the course being easy
		* Contributors:
			* We attribute success to ability and effort
			* We attribute failures to external factors
			* We see ourselves as better than average
			* We overestimate how much others agree with us
			* We are unrealistically optimistic about our future
			* We overestimate the commonality of our flaws
			* We underestimate the commonality of our abilities
		* This applies less to people with lower self-esteem
	* Selective perception: we only select certain things to pay attention to when making attributions
* How do we minimize these errors?
	* Increase personal interaction -- talking to them, getting to know them and understanding them
		* Focus on unique attributes of individuals
	* Identify and confront your stereotypes, don't be defensive about them 

## Diversity and Discrimination

* Diversity should be valued, not just tolerated
	* This creates a culture of fairness
* Properly managed Diversity can create a competitive advantage, including improved problem solving, creativity, recruiting and marketing, and global competitiveness
* Stereotypes create barriers to diversity in the workforce
	* Generalization and ignorance of variations create a toxic environment -- they expect everyone to fit into the same categories
	* Members of a social group feel they might be judged or treated according to a stereotype, which creates a worse environment
* Discrimination is a distinction, exclusion or preference based on a prohibited ground, as set out by law
* Discrimination can be intentional or unintentional
	* Intentional discrimination is direct, involving unequal treatment and direct prejudiced actions
	* Unintentional discrimination is indirect, constructive or systemic and unintentional, embedded in policies and neutral actions
