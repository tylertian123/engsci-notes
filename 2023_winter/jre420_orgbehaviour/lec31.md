## Ethics

* Decision makers need to consider important questions about challenges, e.g. bribery and corruption, nationalism, discrimination, etc
* Societal values shift over time and ethical issues shift with it -- ethics is dynamic
* Ethics is viewed as systematic thinking about the moral consequents of decisions -- who does it impact and how does it impact them?
	* Moral consequences can be framed in terms of the potential harm to stakeholders
* Ethical conflict focus on disagreements due to differences in philosophy; institutional conflicts focus on disagreements due to differences in policy
* Why do we engage in unethical behaviour?
	* Personal gain
	* Role conflict (differences between what you want vs. what the organization wants)
	* Strong organizational identification (doing what's best for the organization, even if it's not the best for everyone else)
	* Organizational and industry culture (what is expected in the organization/field isn't necessarily ethical, e.g. corruption)
	* Competition
	* Personality
		* The cynical and those with an external locus of control are less tuned in to ethical matters
		* Low conscientiousness, low agreeableness, high neuroticism
		* High n Pow, strong economic values (i.e. valuing power and money) both make people more likely to behave unethically
		* Also individual differences in people's degree of sophistication when thinking about moral issues
* Ethical managerial behaviour consists of ethical behaviour, social responsibility (fairness and advocating for justice, for local and global communities), environmental stewardship and fair employment practices
* There are 3 traditional branches of ethics and 2 additional concepts:
	* Virtue ethics (Aristotle): focused on your character; prudence, temperance, courage and justice
		* Your character pushes you to behave ethically
	* Deontology/duty ethics (Immanuel Kant): rooted in rules; the intent is more important than the consequences
		* Process matters; if you follow the process, then it is ethical regardless of consequences
	* Utilitarianism (John Stuart Mill): maximizing benefit for maximum number of people
		* The process doesn't really matter as long as utility is maximized
	* Human rights perspective (John Locke): rooted in everybody having the right to life, liberty, and dignity; this supersedes everything else
	* Ethics of care (Nel Noddings): rooted in developing relationships and empathy
* Definitions:
	* Ethics: Moral principles that govern a person or a group's behaviour
	* Diversity: Recognizing the demographic and experiential heterogeneity of a group
	* Equity: Creating opportunities and removing barriers to address historic and current disadvantages
	* Inclusion: Creating a welcoming environment where people feel they belong
* Ethical theories have variabilities, so ethics are conveyed in laws and policies, e.g. human rights laws, labour laws, accessibility laws
* Ethical dilemmas often faced by organizations include:
	* Honest communication (e.g. misleading customers to sell a product)
	* Fair treatment (equitable and ethical treatment)
	* Special consideration (e.g. favors)
	* Fair competition
	* Responsibility to organization
	* Corporate social responsibility (making a positive change in the world)
	* Respect for law
* Ethical guidelines: identify stakeholders, costs and benefits present and future, consider the moral expectations, the nature of the dilemma, and discuss with stakeholders
* More equity concepts:
	* Privilege: invisible advantages linked to a social dimension
	* Implicit discrimination: subtly discriminatory practices
	* Identity: part of your identity being central and other parts of your identity not being visible unless they are of interest -- there is more to what we are than meets the eye
	* Inclusion: not just that you are something (identity), but also that you belong there
