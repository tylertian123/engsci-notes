## Emerging Theories of Leadership

* Emerging leaders are guided by their values; followers look to their leaders to determine their behaviour
* Global leadership: involves having leadership capabilities required to function effectively in different cultures (crossing language, social, economic and political barriers)
	* Global leaders deal with diverse employees and customer base as well
	* They typically have experience working and living in different countries and cultures
	* Need a global mindset, tolerate high levels of ambiguity, and exhibit adaptability and flexibility to adapt to local cultures
	* 4 key characteristics:
		1. Unbridled inquisitiveness: continuously asking questions to learn about different cultures
		2. Personal character: prioritizing people
		3. Duality: can manage both uncertainty and innovation
		4. Savvy: high resourcefulness, can use tools and resources to their advantage; seeing opportunities
* Authentic leadership: focuses on the leader coming to the table with a number of behaviors, including understanding their own strengths, weaknesses, and capacity
	* 4 related behaviours:
		* Self-awareness: Understanding of one's own strengths, weaknesses and capacity
		* Relational transparency: presenting the true authentic self to others
		* Balanced processing: objective analysis of relevant information before making decisions, including discussion with other experts
		* Internalized moral perspective: internal moral standards and values guide behaviour and decision making
	* Authentic leadership increases the ownership of followers and is especially good for trust
	* Authentic leadership increases psycap, builds trust among members, which results in higher group citizenship behaviours and higher performance
* Empowering leadership: implementing conditions that enable power to be shared with employees (leading by handing over the keys rather than sitting in the driver seat)
	* Valuing participation and autonomy
	* Providing structural, relational, and psychological empowerment by removing barriers
		* Structural empowerment is removing barriers and giving power (e.g. access to information, time, capital, people)
		* Psychological empowerment is enabling the development of meaning, competence, self-determination and impact
	* Empowerment is not delegation, but enablement (not just offering the tool, but teaching them how to use it)
* Servant leadership: going beyond self-interests and having a genuine concern to serve others
	* Servant leaders want to serve first and lead second; they aim to empower people
	* Servant leaders focuses on what supports their community the most and are not in it for any personal gain (e.g. unions, religious organizations)
	* Intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation, collective rather than individualistic
	* Leading with humility, authenticity, acceptance, and values
	* Advisors, mentors, counselors, not to direct but to guide
	* Aboriginal leaders are an example of this
* Ethical leadership: being the role model for normative behaviour and decision making; setting and following ethical standards
	* Bearing the onus of rewarding and disciplining others for adherence -- giving them a reason to uphold ethical principles
	* Ethical leadership is challenging since they need to be ethical all the time -- ethical behaviour is personal
	* Leader's behaviours affect follower's behaviours through their relationships and actions, ultimately leading to follower being ethical as well
	* Positive effects include better performance, fewer counterproductive behaviours, and more honesty, fairness, effectiveness; these effects are most present in people closest to the leaders
	* Ethical leadership decreases corrupt behaviour since it encourages followers to report problems to management
	* Typical values include integrity, altruism, humility, empathy and healing, personal growth, authenticity, empowerment, fairness and justice

## Dark Leadership

* Unethical leadership: engaging in behaviours that violate moral or social standards, or rules and laws
	* Leaders that engage in such behaviour promotes similar behaviour from their followers
	* Unethical leaders' typical vices include:
		* Self-serving
		* Deceptive behaviour
		* Hypocrisy
		* Arrogance
		* Lack of social inhibition (thinking that whatever they do should be socially acceptable, thinking that they are above the law/societal norms)
		* High self monitoring (always being aware of how they're seen and controlling it to get a specific outcome)
		* Malevolence
		* Masked intentions (saying that they're doing this because of some reason but in reality the reason is different)
	* Can be motivated by self-interest
	* Doesn't always appear to be such; it is hard to spot
* Pseudo-transformational leadership: being self-centered and manipulating followers for their own gain
	* Transformational leadership but with masked intentions -- leader is focused on their own goals, but telling you otherwise
	* With idealized influence, they wish to be idolized and respected but are not actually earning that respect (making others believe they have referent power)
	* With individualized consideration, they will only care about you as long as it directly benefits them
	* With inspirational motivation, they will still communicate a vision, but it is no longer focused on the organization's needs but rather their own personal needs
	* With intellectual stimulation, they will discourage such behaviour; they will not challenge or motivate followers but rather limiting them from engaging in independent thought and action
* Abusive leadership: sustained hostile and especially nonverbal behaviours (excluding violence)
	* Not yelling or berating someone but mistreating, deceiving, and manipulating them
	* Can typically last as long as the employment relationship
	* Rooted in a power dynamic
	* Usually targeted more towards vulnerable followers, like harassment or discrimination
	* Can be cyclic -- individuals subjected to abuse or injustice by their leaders often become abusive themselves
* Dark leadership can often be hard to spot
