## Correspondence Principle

* Quantum effects are important when de Broglie wavelength is comparable to the spacial scale of the phenomenon
	* The phase of wavefunctions also need to be conserved -- if the time scale of action is comparable to quantum decoherence then quantum effects are important
	* Important for quantum computers
* The core of quantum mechanics is the quantization of energy given as $\Delta E$
	* The classical limit is defined as $\Delta E \ll kT$
	* In this limit thermal collisions blur out any resemblance of a wave and the system behaves classically
* The correspondence principle states that there is a continuous bridge from discrete quantized resonance conditions of the quantum world to the continuum variables of classical mechanics
	* e.g. for the infinite potential well $E = \frac{h^2n^2}{8mL^2}$, if $L$ or $m$ are on the classical scale, then $E$ is extremely small and energy approaches a continuum
* Example: Protein motion
	* Functionally relevant motions of proteins are on the scale of 1 to 10 angstroms
	* de Broglie wavelength calc be calculated using the mass and thermal velocity, and turns out to be $\SI{1.8e-13}{m}$
	* This is much smaller than an atom so the system is not quantum

## Long Range Intermolecular Forces

* Ionic bonds, covalent bonds, metallic bonds
* Metallic bonds are covalent bonding with different degrees of ionic character
	* Metals typically involve 3d or higher valence orbitals
	* This creates an electronic continuum and facilitates conduction

## Short Range Intermolecular Forces

* Ion Coulombic dipole coupling: polar molecule with a permanent dipole moment interact with ions
	* Dipole moments result from large differences in electronegativities between bonded atoms
	* Potential function on the order of $\frac{1}{r^6}$
	* Bonding from 40-600 kJ/mol
	* e.g. dissolving a sodium ion in water perturbs 80 water molecules
* The hydrogen bond
	* Hydrogen bonds to oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine
	* The high specificity of this force imposes directions on biological molecules
	* Hydrogen bonds encode information in DNA, provide protein building sites, nucleation sites, etc
	* Also on the order of $\frac{1}{r^6}$
	* Bond energies of 10-40 kJ/mol
* Dipole-dipole interactions
	* Same physics as hydrogen bonds but 2 to 8 times weaker
	* Bond orders of 5-25 kJ/mol
	* Also on the order of $\frac{1}{r^6}$ for potentials
* Ion induced dipole interactions
	* Ions polarize an otherwise neutral atom, creating a dipole
	* Only occurs when the ion is in close proximity
	* Oxygen transport uses this to bind oxygen to ion in heme proteins
	* 3-15 kJ/mol
	* Potential on the order of $\frac{1}{r^4}$
* Dipole-induced dipole interaction
	* Even weaker, works the same
* Induced dipole-induced dipole: van der Waals force (aka dispersion or London forces)
	* Spontaneous movement of charges create temporary dipoles that induce more dipoles
	* Occurs when all molecules are strictly nonpolar
	* Weakest force, but powerful in numbers
