## Molecular Spectroscopy

* Why does a molecule or atom absorb light?
	* The incoming photon is an electromagnetic wave, which moves the electron
	* This physically distorts the electron density and changes it into the shape of another stable configuration, e.g. 2s to 2p
* Spectroscopy measures emission wavelengths
	* The spectrum has a finite width which comes from the uncertainty principle, $\Delta E\Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$ where $\Delta t$ is the lifetime of the excitation
	* There is also a fundamental line resolution (distance between lines)
* Selection rules exist to determine whether transitions can take place -- not all transitions happen
	* Transitions are either allowed (high probability) or forbidden (low probability)
	* Not a hard yes or no but probabilistic
* The dipole moment $\mu$ in an atom creates a potential difference when an electric field (photon) comes along $U = \mu E$
* The expectation value for the electric field to create a dipole moment via the mixing of electron distributions from the ground and excited states is only nonzero when we have a symmetry
	* Example: from an s orbital to p orbital involves a change in symmetry, so the transition is allowed (symmetry allowed); from 1s to 2s has no change in symmetry so it's not allowed (symmetry forbidden)
	* The change in $l$ is always $\pm 1$
	* There must be no spin multiplicity: $\Delta S = 0$
