## Stability and Bonding

* Elements with a high $Z_{eff}$ have higher electron affinity, and tend to form nonmetals (e.g. the halogens)
* When two atoms are brought near each other, the electron density builds up between them and screens the proton charge
	* When the two electrons are moving towards each other, the state has higher energy; this is an *antibonding* state
	* When they are moving away from each other, the state has lower energy; this is a *bonding* state
* We can solve the problem of one electron and two protons, which corresponds to the case of $\ce{H_2+}$
	* In the antibonding state electron density depletes in the centre due to the destructive interference, so the electrons are concentrated near the outside
		* The higher energy of the antibonding state tends to pull the molecule apart
	* In the bonding state electron density builds up in the centre; the electrons are concentrated near the centre
		* The bonding state has lower energy since the high electron density in the centre is closer to the protons
	* In the bonding state, there is a minimum in the energy as a function of the inter-proton distance, which facilitates bonding
* When the overlap is spherically symmetric you get a $\sigma$ bond (s orbitals)
