## Hydrogen Bonds

* Hydrogen atoms are bonded to oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine
	* The hydrogen is partially positive; the other atom is partially negative due to electronegativity differences
	* Chlorine does not form hydrogen bonds because it's screened due to ionic bonding
* This force imposes directions on biological molecules
* Typically denoted with a hashed line
* Only a hydrogen bonded to oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine can hydrogen bond
* Carbon doesn't form hydrogen bonds because its typical high valence of 4 contributes to more screening
* Hydrogen bonds give water special properties:
	* higher boiling point and melting point relative to its degree of hydrogen bonding
	* Higher density in liquid phase and anomalous negative thermal expansion
	* High heat of fusion and heat of vaporization
	* High specific heat -- drives the Gaia effect
	* High dielectric constant (critical to hydrogen transfer)
	* Anomalous long-range correlations in its liquid structure
	* Anomalous high surface tension, yet low bulk viscosity
		* This is due to the fluctuation of hydrogen bonds
* Water has the most hydrogen bonding per unit mass than anything else -- why is it a liquid at room temperature with such low viscosity?
