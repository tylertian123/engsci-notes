## Overview of Thermal Physics

* Systems of particles typically exhibit *universal* behaviour: behaviour that applies to all systems, regardless of composition
* e.g. speed of particles in any gas that isn't too cold or too dense follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution $n(v) \propto ve^{-kv^2}$ in 2D, $n(v) \propto v^2e^{-kv^2}$ in 3D
* Statistical mechanics forms an "explanation" of thermodynamics, providing a bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic, through the main postulate of SM
* What do we need to describe a system of $N$ particles microscopically?
	* This gives the most detailed description
	* In classical mechanics we would have $\vec r_i(t), \dot{\vec r}_i(t)$ for $i = 1, \cdots, N$
	* For large $N$ (on the order of $10^{23}$) this would be hopeless to compute and useless to interpret
* To describe them macroscopically instead we use:
	1. The number of particles $N$
	2. The volume $V$
	3. The pressure $p$
	4. The temperature $T$
* Statistical mechanics connects these two
* Note both thermodynamics and statistically mechanics deal with systems in thermodynamic equilibrium:
	1. The system is uniform throughout its volume (density, pressure, temperature)
	2. These properties do not change in time
	3. No macroscopic fluxes -- on average the net flow through any surface is zero
* Ideal classical gases have many particles, can be treated as point like objects classically and obeys the ideal gas law $pV = NkT$ where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant $k = \SI{1.38e-23}{J/K}$
