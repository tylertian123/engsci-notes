## Electron Spin

* The Zeeman effect: in the presence of a strong magnetic field, the spectral lines spread out
	* This is because of the angular momentum from $L_z = m\hbar$ generating a magnetic dipole; the applied magnetic field makes it so that the states with different spin are no longer degenerate
	* With an even stronger field the lines split again due to spin
	* Spin can be detected with electron spin resonance
* Spin quantum number is $m_s$, with possible values $\pm \frac{1}{2}$
* This allows 2 electrons to occupy the same atomic orbital
