## Unique Properties of Water and Hydrogen Bonds

* Water's hydrogen bond network imposes a minimum volume constraint to drive hydrophobic collapse
	* This forces minimum volume constraints on structures like proteins and drives folding
	* Like how oil forms a sphere in water, but not in hexane
* Hydrogen bonds connect long range forces and makes it flexible so it can flow
* Levinthal's Paradox: Given the astronomical number of permutations, how can proteins find their biological structures?
	* For every amino acid linkage there's 3 degenerate orientations, so even just with that there's $3^{100}$ permutations or $10^{47}$
	* Even sampling one orientation every $10^{-13}$ seconds (fastest possible) this would take longer than the age of the universe
	* Yet proteins fold on the order of micro to milliseconds
	* Solution: inherent correlations involved in the fluctuations; the assumption that all degrees of freedom are independent is wrong
	* Analogy: What is the optimal strategy to find a parking lot?
		* You instructively try to look further out to see more of the lot at once
		* In this analogy correlated actions are analogous to seeing more of the lot
