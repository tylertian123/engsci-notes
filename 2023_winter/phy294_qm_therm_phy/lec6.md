## Fermions and Bosons

* All electrons are identical, so you can't distinguish between them
	* Therefore a mathematically suitable wavefunction must reflect this
* This is the reason for the Pauli exclusion principle
* If you have two fermions, the wavefunction has to be antisymmetric
	* Electrons are fermions
	* For bosons however, the wavefunctions are symmetric and there is no limit to the number of them in the same quantum state
* If two wavefunctions represent the same quantum state, they must be related through a constant or phase only
* Suitable functions for the PEP must satisfy:
	* Be indistinguishable to electron exchange
	* Normalizable wavefunction
	* Have to include spin
	* Wavefunction must be antisymmetric to electron exchange
