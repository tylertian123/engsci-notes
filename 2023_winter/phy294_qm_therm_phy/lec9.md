## Formation of Molecular Bonds

* When two atoms come together, the sign of the electron wavefunctions determine the phase of the electron movements
* When the wavefunctions have the same sign, the wavefunctions interfere constructively and electron density builds up between the two nuclei; this gives the bonding orbital
	* This represent the two electrons being in phase and so they are always staying far away from each other
* When the wavefunctions have different signs, the wavefunctions interfere destructively so electron density in the middle of the nuclei cancels; this gives the antibonding orbital
	* The electrons are out of phase so they feel stronger repulsion
* For every bonding orbital there is an equivalent antibonding orbital
* A *nonbonding* orbital has the constructive and destructive interference parts perfectly cancel out
* The *orbital overlap* $\braket{\psi _1 | \psi _2} = S_{ab} = S_{ba}$ is the extent to which the two orbitals overlap in space
	* If the two orbitals are orthogonal, they have zero overlap
* When two atoms are brought together, these bonding/antibonding/nonbonding orbitals are created
	* These are shown as states that are lower/higher energy than the original orbitals
	* A nonbonding orbital would be a lone pair
	* Antibonding orbitals are denoted by a star
	* Molecular orbitals are often symmetric; they are denoted $g$ (gerade, even) if they are identical under inversion, or $u$ (odd) if they change sign
* The bond order is defined as the number of electrons in bonding orbitals minus the electrons in antibonding orbitals, divided by 2
	* A bond order of 0 or less cannot exist, e.g. $\ce{He2}$ does not exist because it would have a bond order of $\frac{2 - 2}{2} = 0$
* In the period 2 elements, the additional states create more molecular orbitals
	* In period 2 there are 8 orbitals (4 pairings of atomic orbitals, times 2 for bonding/antibonding)
