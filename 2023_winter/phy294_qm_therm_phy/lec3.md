## The Hydrogen Atom

* Recall:
	* Properties of the hydrogen atom indicated quantum behaviour -- Rydberg's equation
	* Bohr introduced a quantization condition that explained the Hydrogen spectral lines
	* de Broglie proposed that matter has wavelike properties
	* Schr√∂dinger then came up with the wave equation that explained Bohr's quantization condition
	* To solve the hydrogen atom, we take it to spherical coordinates and separate $\Psi(r, \theta, \phi) = R(r)\Theta(\theta)\Phi(\phi)$
* Summary of the Hydrogen solution:
	* $\Psi(r, \theta, \phi) + R_n(r)\Theta _{lm}(\theta)\Phi _{m}(\Phi)$
	* $n = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$
	* $E = -\frac{E_R}{n^2}$
	* $l = 0, 1, 2, \cdots, n - 1$
	* $m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \cdots, \pm l$
	* The ground state is $n = 1, l = 0, m = 0$
	* Total angular momentum is $L = \sqrt{l(l + 1)}\hbar$; $L_z = m\hbar$ is quantized just like Bohr assumed
		* Think about a vector of length $L = \sqrt{l(l + 1)}$ being projected onto the $z$ axis
		* $l$ controls the total angular momentum; $m$ controls how much of it is in the $z$ axis
