## Heteronuclear Diatomic Orbitals

* When two atoms come together with different energies in the orbitals, the electrons in the molecular orbitals will be closer to the one with the lower energy
	* Electron density is greater in the negative ion (lower energy) side
* When the difference in energy is very large, the filled orbital on the negative ion has the same energy as the atomic orbital
* Atomic orbitals most effectively overlap to form molecular orbitals when:
	1. Shapes are conductive to good overlap -- symmetry
	2. Their energies are similar in the separated atoms
* Electronegativity difference $\chi$ between a pair of atoms in a bond defines the unbalanced electron sharing or formation of a polar bond
	* $\abs{\chi _A - \chi _B} = \sqrt{D_{AB} - (D_{A_2}D_{B_2})^\frac{1}{2}}$
	* Normalized so that fluorine is 4
* $\Delta\chi > 1.8$ is ionic; $\Delta\chi < 0.6$ is covalent; in between is polar covalent
* With polar covalent bonds, the bonds have a dipole; the vector sum of the all the bond dipoles is the overall molecular dipole
	* The dipole moment $\mu = qr$ where $r$ is the distance between charges and $q$ is the magnitude of charge separation

## Hybridization

* Add together the s orbitals and p orbital wavefunctions
