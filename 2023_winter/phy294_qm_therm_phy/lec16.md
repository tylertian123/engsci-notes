## IR Spectroscopy

* With infrared light we can see the vibrational motion of atoms in a bond
* A vibrating molecule behaves like two masses joined by a spring
* The potential is $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
	* $k$ is the force constant related to the bond strength -- double and triple bonds are stronger and have larger $k$
	* The same resonant frequency works also in the quantum case
* In a real molecular bond the potential differs, giving it an *anharmonic character*: $E = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)h\nu - x\left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2h\nu$
	* This allows the states which are otherwise stationary to move
	* The deviation from the harmonic oscillator potential makes different modes coupled which allows for energy transfer
	* $\Delta v = \pm 1$
* Using the absorbance spectrum we can figure out what bonds and structures exist in an atom
	* The width of the lines tell you the lifetime, which comes from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
* To calculate the number of vibrational modes:
	* Each atom has 3 degrees of freedom
	* For a nonlinear molecule subtract 6 degrees (3 translational + 3 rotational of the base atom)
	* For a linear molecule subtract 5 degrees (3 translational + 2 rotational of the base atom)
* Spin multiplicity selection rule: $\Delta S = 0$
* When a vibration is excited, it first undergoes internal conversions (between vibrations), and then falls down back to the ground state via fluorescence from the bottom level
	* With high energy the vibrational energy levels are a lot closer together so energy transition happens very quickly
* The triplet is lower in energy than the singlet (Hund's rule)
	* A singlet state is when an electron undergoes a transition and ends up with opposite spin with another lone electron
	* A triplet state is where both are spin up or down
	* The triplet is always lower energy than the singlet state by Hund's rule
	* Singlet states can flip to the triplet through intersystem crossing, due to the orbital angular motion generating a magnetic field
* Radiative transitions are when photons are absorbed or emitted; non-radiative transitions are when energy is transferred between states in a molecule or to the surroundings (internal conversion)
